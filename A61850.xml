            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>love to the Brethren,</hi> willing in every thing to ſatisfie them, wherein he might not diſhonour or diſpleaſe Chriſt: For as the <hi>way</hi> of glorifying the Father is in his <hi>Son,</hi> and of glorifying his <hi>Son</hi> is in his <hi>Spirit:</hi> So a high way of honouring the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in the Saints.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This will of God was the ground of the creation of men and Angels, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.12. And that which was the cauſe of their being, muſt be the <hi>Rule</hi> of their Acting. Its ſaid of the Angels, <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.20.</note> 
               <hi>They do his Commandment, and hearken unto the Voice of his Word:</hi> He doth <hi>Rule</hi> them by the ſame will that he did <hi>create</hi> them. This is the great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55318:17"/>Office of the Spirit to act them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1.20. Its ſaid of them, <hi>whether the Spirit was to go, thither their Spirit was to go;</hi> and for the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>He maketh interceſsion for them according to the will of God.</hi> Therefore Chriſt teacheth us to pray, that his will may be <hi>done on earth</hi> by us, as by the <hi>Angels and Saints in glory;</hi> with the ſame <hi>readineſs</hi> and the ſame <hi>exactneſs;</hi> even his whole will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian muſt have this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall intention in all his ways, that he may pleaſe God and walk with him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unto all well pleaſing, Col.</hi> 1.10. Now there can be nothing <hi>pleaſing</hi> unto God; but what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto his will, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.22. <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>my ſervant, a man after mine own heart, who ſhall fulfil</hi>

God doth will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becauſe it is good; but it is therefore good, becauſe he wils it. I cannot therefore approve of that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55318:18"/>diſtinction which ſome of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> give, there are <hi>quaedam volita quia bona, &amp; quaedam bona quia volita.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if any thing be willed of God, becauſe it is good, then it is <hi>antecedently</hi> good, to the will of God, which is the only cauſe &amp; Rule of goodneſs.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The will of God as far as it concerns mans Duty, is manifeſted and made known:</hi> which will appear by theſe five particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This the Lord himſelf affirms, <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man what is good; and what doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qure of thee, but to do juſtly and to love mercy, and to walk humby with thy God.</hi> The Original word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, becauſe I am ſure Gods ends are right, what ever mens are. God did it in juſtice, though <hi>Jehu</hi> did it in policy; and a gratious heart may do the ſame action to a holy end, and his perſon &amp; ſervice be accepted; which an ungodly man doth to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt end: And the action (though good in it ſelf) proves a ſin to the man, and is ſo accounted by God. For any therefore to ſay, men do what they do, not for a publike good, but they aim barely at ſetting up themſelves in the Government to deſtroy one way of Tyranny that they may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a greater, that they may add to the <hi>peoples yoak,</hi> and make their little fingers heavier then the loyns of the former Governors; whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do ſo, the Lord will ſurely finde them out; and it will appear that they have coveted an <hi>evil Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

There is <hi>a ſmoak in the Temple, Rev.</hi> 15.8. by which Interpreters commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand three things. Firſt, The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of God in his Church, owning his People, during the time of the pouring out of the <hi>Vials:</hi> for they make it an Alluſion to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55318:103"/>of the preſence of God at the Dedication of the Tabernacle and the Temple. <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13. So <hi>Mede, Grot. &amp;c.</hi> 2. It notes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God againſt his Enemies in the Church; for <hi>ſmoak</hi> is in Scripture <hi>irae divinae ſymbolum, Iſai.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Glaſſ. Rhet. ſacr. p.</hi> 244. And ſo <hi>Mr. Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Docet teſtari Deum praeſentiam ſuam manifeſtis excandeſcentiae argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis &amp;c. in hoſtes &amp;c.</hi> 3. It notes a darkneſs and an obſcurity in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Truths and Ordinances of God, ariſing from the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Innovations which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt brought in. For though it be ſaid to be <hi>from the glory of the Lord, and from his power:</hi> yet it was from God judicially only: And ſo <hi>ſmoak</hi> is taken for corruption of Doctrine and Worſhip: and thereby a darkning of Truth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.2. And this doth appear, becauſe this <hi>ſmoak</hi> did hinder that the <hi>Tabernacle of the Teſtimony in Heaven was not opened,</hi> and that men could not ſee the <hi>Ark of the Teſtament. Rev.</hi> 11.19. But when the Vials
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55318:104"/>are poured out, and Antichriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſtroyed, and all this <hi>ſmoak</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, then there ſhould be this cleer ſight and diſcovery even of the moſt hidden things, <hi>the Ark of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> which was within the vail: for that appears, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath obſerved, to appertain <hi>non ad initium, ſed even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Phialarum.</hi> And concerning this <hi>ſmoak,</hi> the Spirit tels us, 1. That it ſhould laſt and continue during all the time of the <hi>Vials:</hi> ſo that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath brought, through the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that darkneſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity into the Temple and things of God: and that it will never be diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till he be utterly overthrown: for <hi>the Temple is not opened</hi> till the ſeventh Trumpet ſound, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11.19. 2. The Effect of this ſmoak, is, that by reaſon of it <hi>no man ſhould be able to enter into the Temple:</hi> Which hath a double ſenſe given of it, but may fitly be put into one. 1. That no man by reaſon of the darkneſs of the <hi>ſmoak</hi> ſhould be able to ſee &amp; underſtand the myſteries of the Goſpel: for <hi>intrare in adytum eſt Dei arcana diſcere. Pſal.</hi> 73.17. <hi>Grot.</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:55318:104"/>2. By this ſmoak the evidence and glory of the myſteries of God was ſo darkned, that none <hi>comparatively,</hi> that is few, ſhould be converted to God, and added to the Church: For the great Harveſt of the World ſhall be under the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>ſc.</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jews, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles. <hi>Hic fumus non omnes electos ex Gentibus, ſed tantum Judaeos &amp; plenitudinem Gentium ab adytis prohibet. Brightman.</hi> So then, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Antichriſts kingdom, there ſhall be a darkneſs upon the things of God: And this darkneſs ſhall hinder the diſcovery of the truths of God, and a recovery of the ſouls of men; And when the Servants of Chriſt have to their utmoſt labored to clear the things of God, and to diſpel the darkneſs that is upon them, yet they ſhall never be perfectly cleered till all the Vials be fully poured out. And till then the Lord will <hi>ſhake</hi> Churches, that the things that are made in them alſo may be removed. Now who are they that ſerve Gods Ends in this? Either they that labor
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55318:105"/>to remove them, or they that labor to continue them according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Traditions of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord is pouring out the <hi>Fourth Viall upon the Sun,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 16.8.</note> which is the higheſt light in the Romiſh Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, whether it be in Church or State. In the pouring out of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> it is generally obſerved by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, 1. That the ſubject upon which all the Vials are poured, is <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian; For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given, is, to pour out the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the <hi>wrath of God upon the Earth. Rev.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Earth</hi> in this Book is ſometimes oppoſed unto Heaven: and then as by <hi>Heaven</hi> is meant the true and pure Church of Chriſt, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.1. &amp; 12.1. ſo by <hi>Earth</hi> is meant the falſe Church, an Earthly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Church, under Antichriſt as an Head: And ſo it is the kingdom of Antichriſt upon which all theſe Vials are poured out. 2. That the Vials are but ſo many ſeveral degrees of wrath upon this falſe Church, and ſo many ſteps to its ruine. For as <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a day: ſo the Lord
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55318:105"/>will not have it to fall in a day. 3. That the Lord ſets forth this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian State by a Reſemblance of the World, as he had done before in the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> in which all things (as Earth, Sea, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to be underſtood, of ſomething which reſembles theſe. 4. That the <hi>Angels</hi> which are the Inſtruments of vengeance in the pouring out of theſe, do come out of the <hi>Temple, ſc.</hi> the Reformed Churches (the vengeance being that of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the prayers of the Saints there) and that they ſhall be godly men, or at leaſt generally ſo reputed. For they are <hi>cloathed with pure and white linnen, and having their breaſts girded with golden girdles.</hi> 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Vial is poured out upon, it is for its ruine: and upon whatſoever in this Antichriſtian State the Vial is poured out, the Lord doth ſo manage things in providence, that they do all work for the ruine thereof: And all the Powers of the Earth ſhall not be able to ſupport it under a Vial poured out.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, we
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55318:106"/>are to obſerve that the <hi>Sun</hi> being the greateſt light in the natural world, doth reſemble that which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in this <hi>myſtical and Antichriſtian world: ſc.</hi> the higheſt power and the greateſt authority therein, as <hi>cap.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. which ſome underſtand to be the <hi>German Empire,</hi> unto whoſe <hi>root</hi> the ax hath now been laid for thirty years together. Others obſerving that the Empire is but <hi>an image of the former beaſt</hi> ſet up by the Pope, and that he gives life to it; they ſay that the Pope is the greateſt light in the Antichriſtian World: Both which may ſtand together (for, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinata non pugnant.</hi>) It is Antichriſt and his power that is wholy ſtruck at in the Vials: And though through all the Ten <hi>Kingdoms</hi> there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral chief lights in their own hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (for, <hi>they received power as Kings the ſame hour with the Beaſt</hi>) and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all theſe this Vial is poured: yet the main <hi>wound</hi> is given to Antichriſt in their downfal. For the Judgement upon them is but ſo far as they hold of and relate unto <hi>Rome,</hi> as far as they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55318:106"/>have correſpondence with <hi>Rome.</hi> The whole current of the Book of the Revelation runs this way. I cannot conſent that God is now pouring out the <hi>fifth viall</hi> upon the <hi>Throne</hi> of the Beaſt, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Iohn Cotton</hi> upon the fifth vial.</note> which ſome holy and learned men affirm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it is evident, that the overthrow of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> (which is conceived to be meant <hi>by the throne of the Beaſt</hi>) was not the main thing intended in this deſtruction; for it was overthrown but as an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as that which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it, and ſo hindered the Vial upon the Sun. <note place="margin">

               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:55318:107"/>then we are to ſay, It is the Sword of <hi>the Lord</hi> and of <hi>Gideon; Digitus Dei hic eſt.</hi> Surely theſe are ſigns of the <hi>effecting</hi> Will of God, and not barely of his <hi>permitting</hi> Will. Theſe things I deſire may be ſeriouſly conſidered upon theſe three grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There ſhould be no good bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs which God hath on foot in the world but I ſhould deſire to have a hand in it. A good man hath an eye upon all the work that God hath to do in the world, and would be acting in it. Saith he, whatſoever God is doing, I would gladly be a worker together with God in, either in my practice, my purſe, my prayers, or ſome way or other.</p>
            <p>I would be very loth to miſplace my prayers, and to ſet my prayers in oppoſition to the Will of God. Herein is much of the happineſs of the Saints and Angels in heaven, that they pray for nothing but what God will grant. God is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his peoples prayers. <hi>Pray no more,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Ieremy.</hi> If there be a perſon or buſineſs which the Lord
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55318:108"/>will not proſper, he will put it out of the hearts of his people to pray for it; your prayers are the choiſeſt actions of your life, and if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſincere heart, (though that particular thing which thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt may not be granted, yet) God will anſwer thee ſome other way: yet a good heart would be loth to loſe his prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would be loth to loſe my reward; the Spirit of God teacheth a man not only to act Grace, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a reward of it. No man ſhall ride with the Lamb in triumph after Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, that did not joyn with him in the Combate and Oppoſition: And thoſe that ſuffer with him in the Conflict, ſhall certainly after the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory <hi>ride</hi> with him <hi>upon white horſes,</hi> and have a ſhare in the triumph, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.14. For if <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> be rewarded of God, for joyning with him in his effecting will, even from a corrupt principle, unto a corrupt end; how much more ſhall they who deſire to know what God is doing, and in ſincerity deſire to further his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55318:108"/>ends in the doing of it? Who not only do Gods work, but aym at his end: ſurely not only a temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is reſerved for them, but it ſhall add to their eternal glory, and make their Crown more maſſie, at the laſt and great day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Let us now come to the laſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and that is the <hi>permitting will of God.</hi> If the Lord will bring the Apoſtle to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him by the malice of the Jews, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hoc fraeno co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibendi ſunt omnes noſtri affectus; ne quid tam acerbum ſit, vel triſle, vel durum, quod non mitiget ac emolliat Dei voluntas,</hi> Calv.

            <p>Secondly, we are to conſider, that the permitting will of God, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the reaſonable creature, to whom properly his commanding will belongs. It is true, that all the Creatures come under his will, <hi>For he rules all things according to the counſel of his own will: He doth whatſoever he will in heaven and in earth, <note place="margin">Rev. 4.11.</note> in the ſea, and all deep places.</hi> It is by his will that they are created, and it is by the ſame will, by which they are preſerved and governed in their being. <note place="margin">Ex neceſſitate naturae &amp; ad ultimum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae.</note> But all other creatures being to act <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> no permiſſion can belong to them: but God either acts them, or ſuſpends their Acts at his pleaſure, not by a <hi>permitting,</hi> but by a powerfull <hi>effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will. Only the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſeeing they were created to act out of choice and election, the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55318:110"/>Lord rules them <hi>Modo proportionate,</hi> according to their own nature: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath not put a Law in their natures, which ſhall neceſſarily and infallibly carry them to their ends; but he rules them in a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and they are voluntary in all their actings; neither ſhall any of them be confirmed or made impeccable but by grace, in which the Lord would have all the veſſels of mercy to ſtand; as they were choſen in Chriſt, ſo by him they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: That as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nor God the Creator, <hi>in ordine naturae,</hi> ſo they ſhould honour the Son, as Mediator, <hi>in ordine gratiae:</hi> And for this cauſe, whereas the Lord could have confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Men and Angels in the day of their Creation; as he hath now the Angels in heaven, and the <hi>ſouls of juſt men made perfect;</hi> yet he will not, but reſerves it as a bleſſing that ſhould come in by the Government of his Son, in a way of grace, by whom the <hi>beatifical viſion</hi> is beſtowed upon the Saints. And therefore I conceive Chriſt is called <hi>The Angel of Gods
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55318:111"/>face,</hi> that is. <hi>Qui faciem Dei quaſi conſpicuam populo fecit,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. Now the face of God in Scripture is put for three things. 1. For a full <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will,</hi> They ſhall ſee his <hi>face, and his name ſhall be written in their foreheads,</hi> Rev. 22.4. 2. <hi>For a full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his favor;</hi> So the Church is ſaid <hi>To ſeek the face of God:</hi> And the Lord is ſaid <hi>to cauſe his face to ſhine upon his Saints,</hi> Pſal. 67.1. 3. <hi>A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect viſion of his glory,</hi> and ſo heaven is a <hi>ſeeing of God face to face,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. And in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll theſe reſpects Chriſt is ſaid to be the Angel that diſcovers the face of God unto the Saints. And it is by this laſt manifeſtation that they are made impeccable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The permitting will of God is only converſant about the ſins of the reaſonable Creatures: in all their good actions the Lord doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, and act them, by an efficacious and a working will; ſo as it is rather Gods work then theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Yet not I but the grace of God that was with me; Cooperando perfecit, quod ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando incipit.</hi> Auſt. But for evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55318:111"/>God cannot have a hand in them as the Author or Efficient cauſe; for he is <hi>light, and in him is no darkneſs at all;</hi> he is goodneſs it ſelf, <hi>and in him is no evil,</hi> neither can any evil come from him, <hi>James</hi> 1.13, 14. The caſe is decided, that God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sin, neither can be; for he that forbids all ſin, cannot work any; darkneſs cannot proceed from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights,</hi> and yet againſt his will ſin cannot be; <hi>Non fit aliquid niſi Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotens fieri velit vel ſinendo, vel fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendo.</hi> Auſt. Sin could not have come into the world, if God would have kept it out; he could have created all the creatures impeccable, if he had pleaſed.</p>
            <p>There is a threefold order to be obſerved concerning the decrees of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſame Soveraign Lord that did elect ſome to life, did decree to <hi>paſs by others,</hi> and not to confer the ſame grace and favour upon them. For we teach no abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a preterition only, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>election, or which the Schoolmen
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55318:112"/>call <hi>Reprobatio negativa,</hi> which as <hi>Suarez</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>opuſc. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 175. <hi>Non eſt poena, ſed ſolum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio gratuiti beneficii quod Deus ut ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premus Dominus negare poteſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Unto theſe he doth reſolve and decree not to give grace; but to leave the other to the inſtability of their own wills.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He doth decree, that he will for their ſin caſt them off for ever, and eternally deſtroy them. So that the Lord decreed to leave the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto that ſtrength which he had received in his Creation, and then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he did decree to damn him for that ſin, which he did of himſelf vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily commit. Thus God did from eternity decree to permit ſin to come into the world, though it be the act of the Creatures, and not of God. And hence it was, that <hi>ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and death by ſin, Rom.</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lord in his permiſſion doth withhold his grace, and doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that which ſhould keep a man from ſin, but leave a man to walk in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55318:112"/>his own ways, to act according to his own counſels, and doth not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually determine his will unto that which is good, but leaves it to be freely carried away to that which is evil. Therefore permiſſion is as it were the removing of the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no more: As <hi>Twiſſ. Vindic. part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 28. hath well obſerved, <hi>Ex remotione impedimenti effectus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdum ſequitur, cujus cauſa non eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movens impedimentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſed aliquid aliud.</hi> As if a ſtone being ſtaid from falling, you remove the impediment, then it falls immediatly, the ſtop being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; but the taking away of the ſtop, is not properly the cauſe of its fall, but its own natural form which hath a tendency to its center. So when there is reſtraining grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man, an impediment put in the way of ſinning, <hi>his way is hedged up;</hi> but when the Lord removes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the man immediatly falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin: And yet the taking away of the reſtraint is not the cauſe of his ſinning, but his own natural propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and inclination of Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55318:113"/>The Lord doth by permiſſion but remove the impediment, take away the reſtraint. As a man taking his hand from a <hi>glaſs,</hi> it breaks; not becauſe he takes away his hand, but from its own brittle nature: ſo there is a <hi>Divina manutenentia,</hi> which the Lord takes away: As a man that doth looſe an Anchor, and lets a Ship drive into the Main, when by the Wind and the Sea its daſhed againſt the Rocks: thus the permiſſion of God is but a removing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints that are upon the ſpirits of men. In ſinfull and holy actions three things are to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The action it ſelf;</hi> ſo the Lord doth concur unto both by a common Providence unto both the beings and the motions of the Creatures. They muſt depend <hi>à primo motore; For in him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is alſo <hi>the quality of the action,</hi> either good or evil. And here is a different concurrence of God. 1. To a gracious action, the Lord concurs not only in the ſubſtance of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55318:113"/>it, but in the goodneſs and rectitude of it: For we have no <hi>ſufficiency of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. When we turn to him, it is he <hi>turns us</hi> firſt; when we make our ſelves <hi>a new heart,</hi> it is he firſt <hi>gives us a new heart;</hi> when we <hi>work with him, he works our works in us and for us.</hi> The Lord concurs to it with a gracious and efficacious will. It depends more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the act of God, then upon the act of the creature. But in the evil and obliquity of an action, the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs by a permitting will only, leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature to act according to its own rules, and to walk after its own imaginations, taking away the powerfull determination of grace, and all the reſtraints that were before laid upon them. Now the act is of God, but the obliquity and the defect of the action is from the Creature only.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are the ends of the action, and the Lord doth appoint them alſo: Of good actions, the end is his glory, according to the intention of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; and of evil actions, the end
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55318:114"/>is his glory, though it be <hi>praeter inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Agentis.</hi> As an Artificer uſeth natural cauſes unto artificial ends: as we ſee the Loadſtone that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draws Iron, how it is made uſe of in the Art of Navigation; and we commonly uſe the natural enmity of a Dog or a Hawk to accompliſh our end on ſome other of the creatures, elſe unſerviceable to us. So doth the Lord over-rule the natural enmity of the creature, and orders it unto his own ends, the glory of his own Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Juſtice: As we ſee in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> though he as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God, intends no ſuch thing, he thinks not ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. And in theſe properly doth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of permiſſion conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee the permitting will of God, being converſant only about ſin, and that only the acts of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature, in what particulars it is exerciſed, what it is that the Lord doth permit in them. And they are theſe eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God leaves remainders of ſin in the beſt of his people.</hi> This belongs unto
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55318:114"/>his permitting will, that though they be ſanctified, it is but in part. He doth ſuffer ſin to remain in them, that if the beſt men ſay <hi>they have no ſin, they deceive themſelves,</hi> and <hi>the truth is not in them:</hi> Sin dies a crucified death, it hath only received its deaths wound, and dies by degrees: There is in the beſt, a Law of the members, as well as a Law of the minde; which makes them cry out, <hi>Vnclean, undone, wretched man that I am! Non peccare in via praeceptum eſt, in patria praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> It is in this life our Law, and in the life to come it ſhall be our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; it is here our duty, then our glory. <hi>Peccatum in renaſcentibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur, in proficientibus minuitur, in reſurgentibus tollitur.</hi> Auſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſuffers Satan, both as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and as an accuſer;</hi> and it is for theſe ends that he hath not yet his full tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He knows the time is not yet full come, <hi>Art thou come to torment me before the time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Lord ſuffers him as <hi>a Tempter;</hi> this was a great part of the humiliation of Chriſt, the King of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55318:115"/>Saints, that he was not only made fin by God, but he was tempted unto ſin by the Devil. <hi>And he ſuffered being tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.18. All the Saints are there called <hi>thoſe are tempted,</hi> and tempted as we are. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. and the people of God had need of ſuccour, not only in their ſufferings, but eſpecially in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. And there is no poſſbility for them to ſtand out againſt them without ſuccour from Chriſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Satan comes upon them by his own immediate <hi>injections,</hi> which the Apoſtle calls <hi>fiery darts,</hi> becauſe they are apt to take ſhot as Granadoes and Wild fire into the Camp of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: So it is ſaid, <hi>Satan did move Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to number the people,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. The word doth ſignifie, to perſwade by force of Argument, and by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and continual importunity, to take no denial. And herein properly doth the ſtrength of a temptation lie, in the ſtrength of the Arguments, and the reaſonings of it, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of it from day to day. Its uſed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55318:115"/>in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. if a man <hi>doth perſwade and entice his friend ſecretly to other Gods,</hi> gives him reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade him thereunto. Its the ſame word that is uſed of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Whom Iezabel his wife ſtirred up:</hi> She provoked him by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt perſwaſions, by continual impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. And ſometimes he makes uſe of the Creatures, and there is no creature that Satan will not make uſe of, to withdraw from God, and to draw to ſin: A Diſciple, a Friend, a Wife; God made her a rib, Satan a dart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He permits him as <hi>an ac cuſer;</hi> for he is called <hi>the accuſer of the brethren.</hi> And as he doth move us againſt God in a way of ſinning; ſo he doth move God againſt us in a way of Judgment. And therefore, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1. Its ſaid, <hi>Satan ſtood at Ioſhua's right hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him.</hi> Some ſay, as an accuſer, the manner being to ſet the accuſers on the right hand of the perſon accuſed: Others take the right hand for the inſtrument of action, and ſo it was effectually to hinder <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55318:116"/>work. So <hi>Iob</hi> 2.3. the Lord faith, <hi>Thou haſt moved me againſt him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe;</hi> the ſame word is there uſed, of his moving God againſt <hi>Job,</hi> as before he had moved <hi>David</hi> againſt God: in the one as <hi>a tempter,</hi> in the other as <hi>an accuſer.</hi> And there is as great fear of <hi>Satan</hi> in the one, as in the other. Now it is by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting will of God, that it ſhould be ſo, that the Saints ſhould in a great meaſure lie under the power of this <hi>envious man;</hi> firſt to entice them, and afterwards to accuſe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſuffers the luſts of Godly men to arïſe,</hi> and they are many times led captive under the Law of ſin; yea, even ſometimes to groſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſins, which do <hi>vaſtare conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> though they cannot <hi>excutere fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi> As <hi>Sampſon</hi> to a way of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>David</hi> to Murther, and that plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Solomon</hi> to Idolatry, and that continued; <hi>Peter</hi> to the denial of his Maſter, and that with the bittereſt execrations, curſing himſelf to Hell, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies, if ever he knew the man: yea, and God
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55318:116"/>doth leave them to harden their own hearts in a way of ſinning, and go on <hi>frowardly in it,</hi> Iſa. 57.17. <hi>Why haſt thou hardned our hearts from thy fear?</hi> Iſa. 63.17. We hardened our hearts <hi>ſinfully,</hi> being by God left to our ſelves: And God doth harden them <hi>judicially,</hi> which is the greateſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that can befall a Saint in this life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God doth ſuffer wicked men to thrive and proſper in an evil way:</hi> In ways of cruelty and oppreſſion. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> gathered <hi>the riches of the Nations like eggs, that none did move the wing or peep.</hi> He rules over the people of God with rigour, ſhews <hi>them no mercy, but upon the ancient he doth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily lay the yoke.</hi> The Ploughers <hi>plough upon their backs,</hi> and <hi>make long furrows;</hi> and wicked men oppreſs <hi>thoſe that are more righteous then themſelves:</hi> And yet the Lord ſeems to ſtand by, and look on, and lets him thrive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in it, <hi>as if he had forſaken the earth:</hi> So the ten Kings <hi>ſhall give their kingdoms to the Beaſt;</hi> the power of laws, and the power of arms, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55318:117"/>thereby ſet up Antichriſt; and he ſhall grow to that power, <hi>That all kingdoms, and nations, and languages ſhall worſhip him: and ſhall ſay, Who is able io make war with the Beaſt? And he ſhall make war with the faints, and ſhall overcome them:</hi> And this ordinarily the Lord doth, that his people ſhould come and cry to him to awaken him; for he ſeems as a man aſleep, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding nothing, but leaving all in the enemies hand: <hi>Awake Lord, why ſleepeſt thou?</hi> Now all theſe belong unto the <hi>permitting will of God,</hi> which is converſant only about the <hi>ſins</hi> of the reaſonable creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is very much of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeen in a mans ſubmiſsion of his will unto this permitting will of God: For the proof of it I ſhall give one Scripture for each of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Submiſsion unto the permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will of God in regard of ſin and the remainders thereof. Though a godly man look upon it as his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as his miſery, eſteems ſinne worſe then death, worſe then hell: Yet ſeeing God will have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55318:117"/>in him, if he muſt ſtill bear this weight, draw this clog after him; if he will ſtill have them to wear their <hi>Grave-cloaths,</hi> the Saints are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to <hi>wait for the reſurrection of the juſt.</hi> No man was more ſenſible of the remainders of ſin, then <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears by his own expreſsion of himſelf, <hi>The greateſt of ſinners, and the leaſt of Saints:</hi> therefore he cries out, <hi>who ſhall deliver me?</hi> Rom. 7.24. Yet he conſiders deliverance is <hi>begun, I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> And therefore ſin ſhall never prevail either to condemnation or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. And with this deliverance the Apoſtle ſits down, and ſubmits unto the will of God untill the day of his <hi>full redemption</hi> ſhall come: though he knew that while he lived here, while with <hi>the minde he did ſerve the Law of God,</hi> yet he ſhould with his <hi>fleſh ſerve the Law of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For ſcandalous Falls, though they be ſuch as thoſe that the people of God ſhould fear and pray againſt, as being ſuch by which they cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed, by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55318:118"/>which they become ſpotted of the world, a blemiſh to their ſociety, and leave an ill name behinde them; and they are ſet forth by God as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples for us to take warning by, to take heed we fall not into the like: yet when the Lord hath ſuffered us to fall into them, we muſt not riſe up and quarrel with him, but we muſt ſay he is juſt and holy, even in thoſe things wherein we are wretched and ſinfull, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33, 34. <hi>Peter</hi> had an admonition from Chriſt, of a very dangerous fall that was near him, and he anſwers, <hi>Though all men forſake thee, yet will not I;</hi> Chriſt tells him, that <hi>before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me thrice.</hi> It was <hi>Peters</hi> duty not in a preſumptuous manner to have told Chriſt in confidence of his own ſtrength; no, you are miſtaken in me; if I die with thee, I will not deny thee: but to have ſaid, Lord, if it be thy will, I had rather die with thee, if by thy grace thou wilt aſſiſt me; I had rather undergo the greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then commit ſuch a ſin; this was <hi>Peters</hi> duty before hand. And
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55318:118"/>after the will of God was manifeſted to permit him to fall as he did, he ſhould have ſaid, Thou haſt ſuffered me thus to fall; it was my great ſin thus to deny thee: But ſince my proud and carnally confident ſpirit in thy wiſdom muſt thus be brought down, and my own weakneſs muſt be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for my further humiliation, thou mighteſt deal with me as it ſeemed thee good; I have no reaſon to quarrel with thee, thou acteſt righteouſly even there where I have acted ſinfully. And as this was <hi>Peters</hi> duty, ſo it is the duty of all the Saints whoſe actual Falls have manifeſted that it was the will of God to humble them by this means: And indeed the Saints when they come to read over the ſtory of their lives, and ſhall ſee therein <hi>Omnes actiones ad ſe pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp; circumſtantias actionum,</hi> as <hi>Suarez</hi> ſaith they ſhall ſee in heaven, they will finde they had as much need of their ſins, as they had of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this preſent life; and <hi>all things ſhall work together for good: Et ſi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, quia ni peccata?</hi> though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55318:119"/>there be three ways which the Lord doth uſe to humble men by:</p>
            <p>Firſt, by letting in his love into their ſouls, the beauty of grace, the excellency of holineſs; and then the ſoul looking down upon it ſelf, is as a man that hath looked upon the Sun, he can ſee nothing. So did the Lord humble <hi>Job</hi> by further diſcoveries of himſelf; ſo he did humble <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> This is the higheſt, and ſweeteſt way of humbling: who an I that the Lord ſhould ſhew in me a pattern of mercy? to me the <hi>greateſt of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is this grace given,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He doth humble men by ſufferings; by afflictions he doth keep man from his purpoſe, and <hi>hides pride from his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, But the worſt way, and the moſt uncomfortable way of humbling is by ſin, when the Lord is pleaſed to leave his people to great ſins and ſcandalous falls: And yet this hath been the condition of ſome of the moſt eminent Saints, as <hi>David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="219" facs="tcp:55318:119"/>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Now we come to the grounds and reaſons of the point, that we may from hence ſee what of godlineſs there is in it, to have our will brought into a conformity unto the permitting will of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The more ſelf-denial there is in any thing, the more of the power of Grace there is expreſt in it; for ſelf-denial in any man is the meaſure of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55318:121"/>all the grace that is in the man, as ſelf-ſeeking is the meaſure of all the corruption: for the body of ſiune in a man is nothing elſe but ſelf-exalted above God. Therefore Chriſt rule is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Let a man deny himſelf, Penitus abneget;</hi> ſelf muſt be denied in every conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in every reſpect; therefore Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that was the pattern of all grace, he was the great pattern of ſelf-denial, and hath left us a Copy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to write after him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>He came not to do his own will,</hi> nor to ſeek his own glory, but as a Servant to be wholly at the will and the command of another. Now Divines common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that there is a threefold ſelf that is reſpectively to be denied. Firſt, there is Self as corrupted ſinfull Self. Secondly, Self as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted natural ſelf. Thirdly, Self as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued moral religious ſelf. Now to deny ſelf-natural is more then to deny ſelf-ſinfull, becauſe that is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be denied, but in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: to deny moral-ſelf, is more then to deny natural ſelf, becauſe that is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55318:122"/>not to be denied, but when it comes in competition. Now this conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our will unto the permitting will of God, exerciſes ſelf-denial in all theſe. Firſt, a man muſt deny na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſelf. If God will have a man ſubject it under the power of wicked men, or will leave him to be hurried in his perſon or eſtate, by the power, and according to the luſt of the devil, and the Lord will ſuffer it, ſtand by, and look on, and not come in for his his help; Now a man may lawfully, yea he is bound in duty to ſeek his own preſervation as Chriſt, that he might not be delivered into the hands of unreaſonable men. He prayed to his Father, and yet the Lord did not deliver him, and he gave them power to apprehend him, and did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Now the will of nature gives place unto the will of duty; and Chriſt ſays, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> Its God that hath given Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan this power to men, and therefore who am I, that I ſhould ſay, Why doſt thou ſo? Secondly, A man muſt deny renewed-ſelf: and truly grace
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55318:122"/>in the man is dearer to him then his life; he would be content to loſe his life, that he may maintain and perfect his grace. It is <hi>the divine nature,</hi> the Image of Chriſt begun in the ſoul, unto the carrying on of which he makes all things ſubordinate, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervrent. Now there is nothing an enemy to renewed ſelf, but ſin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the <hi>luſtings of the Spirit are againſt the fleſh, and the luſtings of the fleſh are againſt the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.17. for they are contrary one to another; for a man to deny the holy deſires of regenerated ſelf, ſo as to be willing to ſtoop in them, becauſe the Lord will have it ſo, and will lead him under the remainders of ſin; therefore even gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſelf in the deſires of it muſt ſtoop, and be content with ſuch an inmate (as a Fuller, and a Collier, dwelling in the ſame houſe, what the one whites, the other ſoils) untill a full redemption; it is the higheſt act of grace in this life to deny a mans ſelf, in reference to the being of ſin within him. As it was the higheſt act of ſelf-denial in Chriſt, that he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55318:123"/>that was <hi>the beauty of holineſs,</hi> ſhould be <hi>made ſin,</hi> reputed a ſinner by man, and have ſin imputed to him by God, to confeſs our ſins as his own, <hi>My ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have taken ſuch hold upon me, that I am not able to look up,</hi> Pſa. 40.12. So for a man to know what ſin is, that it deprives him of Communion with God, defiles his ſoul, is worſe then hell it ſelf; and yet in obedience to God all his days to lie under the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings and remainders of it, it is the higheſt act of grace that a godly man doth put forth in this life: Though this may ſeem a ſmall thing to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, who ſees no evil in ſin, it is the element he lives in, and that by which the comfort of his life comes in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The higher act of Faith a man puts forth, the higher act of grace: for it is ſuitable to a mans faith, that all his grace doth riſe. The life of faith, is the life of the new man. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God:</hi> Now the higheſt acts of faith, are thoſe wherein there is the leaſt of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55318:123"/>ſight; for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>We walk by faith, and not by ſight;</hi> ſo that ſight and faith are oppoſed; the leſs there is as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſight, the more there is as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for faith. As it is made the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that <hi>he conſidered not the dryneſs of his own body, nor the deadneſs of Sarahs womb, but be believed in hope againſt hope,</hi> when he ſaw nothing for the preſent promiſed any ſuch thing: So it is here, for a man to be under the remainders of ſin, <hi>the Law of the members leading him captive,</hi> defiling his ſoul, breaking his peace, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conſcience, blotting his name, and yet for his ſpirit to ſtoop to it out of faith, becauſe Gods will is the rule of goodneſs, and he will not only turn this to his own glory, but he will turn it to my eternal good in the end, that out of this eater ſhall come meat, and out of this ſtrong enemy ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Truly, as the higheſt acts of Gods grace upon us in this world, are in turning our ſins to good, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good in the end out of that which in it ſelf is nothing but evil, ſo the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55318:124"/>higheſt acts of grace in us, are thoſe that do reſt upon God for a holy fruit, even of our failings, and continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements; for there is leſs evil in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then there is in ſinning: that is a rule laid down in the new man; therefore the Saints <hi>chooſe</hi> much <hi>rather to ſuffer affliction, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin,</hi> Heb. 11.25, 26. There is leſs of faith to believe good out of ſuffering, then there is out of ſinning. Now when a man ſees ſin in it ſelf is nothing but evil, and in his preſent ſenſe of it, there is more evil in it then there is in any other thing in the world; it is evil <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> that is, in the eſſence of it, <hi>its evil and only evil;</hi> and yet that God will work good out of it, it is the higheſt act of faith that a man puts forth in this life, to reſt upon God in turning his ſins to good, and to be content, not with ſin it ſelf ſimply, but with the will of God ſuffering it to be. For a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with a hard heart, a blinde mind, a ſtupid conſcience, wreſtling againſt them, looking upon them as more bitter then death, and to be willing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55318:124"/>to die with all his heart to be rid of them, and to count death for ſin as a good exchange, and yet out of faith to ſtoop unto the permitting will of God, ſaying. Surely ſin is not ſo the greateſt evil, as God is the greateſt good; for he can turn ſin into good, and work his own glory, and the good of the creature out of it, or elſe he would never have ſuffered ſin to have come into the world. He can cauſe light to ſhine out of darkneſs, temper a poiſon into a wholſom medicine: therefore I can ſay with <hi>Auſtin, Mala non ſunt bona; tamen ut mala ſint bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt:</hi> Its the higheſt act of Faith, that the man doth put forth in this life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are ſeveral extreams that require a great deal of grace to avoid in a mans Chriſtian courſe. It is the manner of Satan to carry men from one extream to another, and it is very hard to eſcape them: A man muſt cut at a thred; he muſt be a skilfull Pilot to ſail between two dangerous Rocks, and not grate upon the one or the other. The work of grace in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55318:125"/>the heart, as it is very ſpiritual: ſo it is very curious and exact; which will appear, if we conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For a man to hate ſin in the being of it, and to keep that principle up in the ſoul, that he would not have ſin raign, nay he would not have it to <hi>be in his mortal body.</hi> He deſires to <hi>be purged from all filthineſs, both of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> and yet in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God in this mixt eſtate to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and not to murmur while God will ſo continue him to endure ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Inmate: For a man to have <hi>Mortem in deſiderio,</hi> to be content to die, that he may be rid of ſin, and yet to haue <hi>vitam in patientia,</hi> to be willing to live, though while he doth live he knows ſin will be: It is a hard matter for a Chriſtian to walk aright between theſe two extreams, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved;</hi> he is willing to die, to be rid of ſin, and yet content to live with the remainders of ſin, out of the love of ſervice; <hi>to abide in the fleſh is more profitable for you;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the will of God, that <hi>pro
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55318:125"/>hoc ſtatu,</hi> that it ſhall be ſo, and to be in duty content to be out of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the while, it is a very great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in the work of grace in the Saints.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For a man to pray againſt temptation earneſtly, as being the moſt miſerable ſubjection that can befall him, to be liable unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean inveſtings of ſuch a wicked and malicious enemy; That he ſhould have ſuch an immediate acceſs to our ſpirits from day to day, that we ſhould <hi>wreſtle with principalities and pewers</hi> for life concerning heavenly things, and yet humbly to be content be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the will of God that a man ſhould lie under them, and to wait Gods time for his deliverance, and to ſay, if the Lord will not deliver me all my dayes, let his will be done. There are ſome temptations that come upon the ſoul with a great deal of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: <hi>terribilia de fide, horribilia de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitate,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks: motions and injections to Blaſphemy, Atheiſm, Self-murther. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, he had ſuch a temptation once came upon
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55318:126"/>him with that impetuouſneſs, that he was forced for ſome hours to do nothing but repeat that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murther.</hi> It may be <hi>the thorn in the fleſh,</hi> was an immediate meſſenger from hell ſent unto <hi>Paul,</hi> with ſome ſuch violent temptation as this; even the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the damned ſouls in hell, ſuch as <hi>Spira</hi> had, <hi>I would I were above God; for I know he will not have mercy upon me,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. It was ſome horrid temptation which was to be a cure of <hi>Pauls</hi> pride; it was given him that he might not <hi>be lifted up through the multitude of Revelations.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Auſtin</hi> breaks forth, <hi>Quantum ſit ſuperbiae venenum quod non poteſt niſi veneno curari?</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> was mightily awakened by this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, he looked upon it as a terrible affliction, as a thorn in the fleſh that did hurt him and gall him from day to day, and therefore he prayed thrice. It expreſſeth both his frequency and his fervency. But the Lord told him it was his will that he ſhould lie under that temptation, which permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55318:126"/>will of God, being made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, <hi>Paul</hi> muſt not ſlack to pray againſt it, or to be afflicted with it, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be content to lie under it ſo long as it was the will of God to ſuffer it to lie upon him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Lord will leave a man under the hands of wicked men, to be content to let <hi>the Ploughers plough upon his back, and make long furrows,</hi> and from a Principle of Faith <hi>not to make haſte,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from the excellent fruit of it; it keeps the ſoul in a continual calm, in a quiet condition, that though a man earneſtly deſire deliverance, whether for himſelf or for the Churches, pray for it daily; <hi>it pities him to ſee the ſtones of Zion to lie in the duſt,</hi> yet his bow with <hi>Joſephs</hi> abides in ſtrength, his heart is not overcome by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the affliction, ſo as to make him to take any evil courſe for his own or the Churches haſty delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but he is content to ſtay Gods time, until the time of the word comes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. The Word of the Lord tried him. While the Lord
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55318:127"/>would have the oppreſſion to lie on, he will leave his people under the hands of their Adverſaries; till he hath wrought his own good work upon <hi>Sian,</hi> he is content to ſtoop unto this permitting will of God, and wait the Lords leiſure for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For a man to be earneſt in prayer, and yet ſubmit unto the will of God, if his prayer be delayed; Chriſt tels us there is <hi>an importunity</hi> in prayer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a holy kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James</hi> ſaith there is <hi>a fervent prayer,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an active and a working prayer. There is a double importunity in prayer, One from the Fleſh, when a man is very earneſt for the thing he would have, and cannot be content without it. So many a man <hi>howls upon his bed for carn and wine and oyl,</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. from a principle of fleſh, there is many times a great deal of earneſtneſs put into a man; but there is an importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that riſes from duty, that a man can be earneſt in duty, though he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not the thing deſired, yet his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55318:127"/>is held up, and for all that he can be content to ſtay Gods time for the thing, and yet pray as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it from a principle of duty, as if it were granted. It is a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing for a godly man to be able to do this in his whole courſe. It was one of the great difficulties in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity that <hi>Luther</hi> found, <hi>dilata ſperare,</hi> for to keep up his hope, and hope will keep up a mans prayer even in the greateſt delayes of God. For a man to pray againſt ſin, againſt temptation, to pray for deliverance of the Churches from the hands of ungodly men, for the Lord to ſuffer ſin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, the temptation and perſecution to continue, and yet for a mans impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in prayer to be held up, when he is at the ſame time contented to ſubmit unto the permtting will of God, while the Lord will ſuffer ſin and Satan continually to vex him; its a very high pitch of Grace, and a great deal of curioſity there is in this, to be able to cut at a thred, and to be able to keep between theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. Now it is the ſubjection of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55318:128"/>our will unto the permitting will of God that keep, the heart within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, that it runs not out either of theſe wayes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What kind of acts of ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt there be in us unto the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitting will of God?</p>
            <p n="1">1. There muſt be a deep apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Juſtice of God in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting will. So it was in <hi>David,</hi> though it was wicked in <hi>Shimei</hi> to curſe the ruler of the people (and ſome conceive) even <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſed his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour therein, when he ſaid unto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> the high Prieſt, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee thou painted wall. I wiſt not</hi> (or I conſidered not, <hi>that he was the high Prieſt.</hi> Sure it could not be that <hi>Paul</hi> being a Jew, ſhould not know him ſo to be. But <hi>David</hi> looks not at the injuſtice of the Inſtrument, but at the Juſtice of God in it. <hi>The Lord hath ſaid unto him, Curſe</hi> David, and he did acknowledge in that Gods permitting will. So doth <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 12.1. <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and juſt are thy judgements; yet let me reaſonwith thee, why doth the wicked proſper? And
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55318:128"/>wherefore are they happy that deal treacherouſly?</hi> God did ſuffer wicked men to proſper in a way of ſinning; it was an act of his permitting will, which though <hi>Jeremiah</hi> underſtood not, yet his will did ſubmit to it as juſt, becauſe he did acknowledge the will of God to be the rule of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt acknowledge his wiſdom therein; ſo doth <hi>David</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; <hi>the Lord will ſurely requite good for his curſing this day.</hi> He knows how to turn ſin to good, and how to make advantage to the Saints by their worſt temptations, their greateſt ſufferings, and their moſt dangerous fals. He knows how to perfect his grace in their weakneſs, and to temper the deadlieſt poiſon into a moſt excellent medicine, how to profit his people by their lying under the power of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, making them the Scullions to wipe them even as a man would wipe a diſh. He knows how to refine them by that fire which they thought would have conſumed them, and he doth ſit by as a refiner, and he will ſuffer them to lie in the fire no longer
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55318:129"/>then till they are refined. He knows how to work his own end out of all theſe permiſſions: For all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of God are in deſign for a time, till he hath accompliſhed his own purpoſe, Iſa. 10.12. <hi>Till I have wrought my good work upon</hi> Sion.

There is nothing the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, but he will bring good out of it, and he knows how to do it. His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin was an occaſion of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>a better Covenant,</hi> a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons head, a higher righteouſneſs, a greater Sonſhip, <hi>a more excellent name,</hi> and he that can bring ſo much good by the permitting the worſt of evils, we need not fear, but he can bring very great good alſo out of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55318:129"/>and out of the ſufferings of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A man ſhould not fret and be impatient, but labour for a calm and quiet ſpirit under it, becauſe it is the will of God to ſuffer it, and had not he ſuffered it, it had never been. There is as truly a principle of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the permitting will of God, as there is in the commanding and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting will of God; do not impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſcontentedly reaſon, why doth the Lord ſuffer it to be thus? It was that which <hi>David</hi> did quell in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, when they would preſently have taken off <hi>Shimet's</hi> head, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>the Lord hath bidden him,</hi> and who ſhall ſay, Wherefore haſt thou done ſo? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7. his counſel is, <hi>Fret not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the man that proſpers in his way, againſt the man that bringeth wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to paſs.</hi> God ſuffers Satan to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thee, and wicked men to oppreſs thee; take heed of an unquiet Spirit under it; for the permitting will of God acts as truly for the good of his people, as his effecting will. And it is part of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55318:130"/>that portion which the Lord doth make over to them when he ſaith, <hi>I will be thy God;</hi> whatever is in God is theirs, and works for them, though for the preſent it ſeems to make againſt them. <hi>David</hi> in this bewails his own folly, that his ſoul was not quieted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the permiſſions of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth ſet himſelf before us as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample afterwards for a pattern of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be imitated, and a pitch of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be attained, when as he was before in his diſtemper <hi>fooliſh and as a beaſt before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A man ſhould not only deſire that the commanding will of God might ſtand, but his permitting will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and a man ſhould deſire onely to be delivered with a ſubjection to his will. So Chriſt ſaith in his ſubjection to the will of God in <hi>Pilats</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of him, John 19.11. <hi>Thou couldſt have no power over me, unleſs it were given thee from above.</hi> It is only the permitting will of my Father which hath put this power in thy hands, and if it be his will, that I ſhall be delivered into your hands, I
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55318:130"/>do not deſire that this permiſſion of God ſhould be taken off until his time is. I can with ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment lie down under it; <hi>If it be not his will that this cup paſs, his will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Let us then endeavour that the power of grace in us may appear in ſubmiſſion unto the permitting will of God. There ſhould be no teſtimony of Godlineſs in the power of it, but a Godly man ſhould ſearch to find it in himſelf; and if he doth not find it, he ſhould labour after it. James 1.4. <hi>Let patience have its perfect work.</hi> There is a perfect work of grace in the hearts of all the people of God; not perfect in this life as it is in heaven, but yet there is <hi>a fulneſs of the age of the ſtature of Chriſt</hi> in this life. Now look what power grace hath had in any mans heart, the ſame we ſhould deſire it might have in ours, not only ſubduing our wills to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo to the permitting will of God in all things. For it is true <hi>we know in part,</hi> and many things we do
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55318:131"/>not, beauſe we know not. A Gracious heart, his care is to keep his eye open for every new diſcovery of truth, and he carries with him a reſolution to walk anſwerably thereunto, when once it is made known to him by the Spirit of Revelation. Now the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inforce it are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it comes from God it is good. For the will of God is the rule of goodneſs, and it is onely good. It is true that the things willed are not good; and therefore as it is ſin, the Lord doth not will it, but ſuffer it; but yet though ſin be not good, yet it is good that God ſhould glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and work his own ends not only out of the ſervices, but alſo out of the ſins, and the contrary actings of the Creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be given over unto a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſpirit, to diſpute againſt any part of the will of God, is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plagues that a man can be given up to. <hi>Who art thou that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> Rom. 11. Either againſt the will of his purpoſe in his decrees, or elſe the will of his precept in his commands,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55318:131"/>or againſt the withdrawings of grace in his permiſſions; there is ſcarcely a greater plague then to be given over to a gainſaying ſpirit. To call the actions of God into queſtion in either of theſe, it is a ſin that is commonly reproved, Iſa. 1.5. <hi>All the day long I have ſtretched out my hand againſt a diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and gainſaying people.</hi> And its the Judgement that the damned in hell are given up to; they are acted by a gainſaying ſpirit. Therefore Luke 16.29, 30. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith, <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them;</hi> But <hi>Dives</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nay Father</hi> Abram, <hi>if one riſe from the dead again, they will repent.</hi> The beſt way to bring them to Repentance, ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> is to hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Nay ſaith <hi>Dives,</hi> the beſt way to bring them to repentance is by one riſing from the dead again. And if an Angel or a Saint from heaven ſhould preach to men, they would diſpute and reſiſt. So men do againſt the permitting will of God. Why doth God ſuffer this? he can hinder ſin, if he would. <hi>Qui non vetat pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55318:132"/>cum poteſt, jubet.</hi> He that doth not hinder ſin when it is in his power, doth after a ſort further it. Therefore why doth God puniſh man for ſinning, when he might if he had pleaſed have kept man from ſinning? It is a great Judgement to be given up to diſpute the will of God in this manner; for men much to exerciſe their wits in calling the word of God and the waies of God in this manner to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt at the bar of their reaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You pray that <hi>the will of God might be done,</hi> which is, that his whole will might take place, and that there may be wrought in your wils a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto the whole will of God. Now a man ſhould look for the fruit of his prayers in a conformity of his will. Mercies given in anſwer to prayers are double mercies. Its not only a good thing that is given, but it is given as a fruit of a promiſe, and as a teſtimony that a man hath received <hi>the Spirit of ſupplication.</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aſcends up to heaven but that which comes down from heaven. There is no prayer heard of God, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55318:132"/>that which doth proceed from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God acting in the man. Now as you have this teſtimony of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of your prayers, that your wils are ſubdued unto the commanding and the effecting will, labour for the ſame alſo in reſpect of the permitting will of God. And till this alſo be wrought, you have never a full anſwer unto that petition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The permitting will of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints, is but for the time of this life; for it hath reſpect only unto ſin: Now when <hi>ſin ſhall be done away,</hi> then the permiſſions of God, and the forbearance of God ſhall have an end. Therefore the Saints in heaven and <hi>the ſouls of juſt men made perfect,</hi> the Lord doth no more ſuffer ſin to be in them, nor them to be under the power of Satan, tempting and accuſing; They are no longer under the power of wicked men, neither fear they any more to be given over unto ſcandalous falls, it is but for the time of this life. As you are to glorifie the patience of God, becauſe it will laſt but for a time, and then ceaſe; ſo you are to glorifie
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55318:133"/>the permiſſions of God alſo. Seeing therefore it is the way which the Lord hath choſen to himſelf to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for this preſent ſtate, a man ſhould reſolve to ſet himſelf to it. There is a different way of honouring God here and in heaven; our care ſhould be, that we might honour him according to that way which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us while we are here: for this is bringing forth fruit in the ſeaſon thereof. So that as I ſay, improve Ordinances becauſe that they ſhall laſt but for the time of the diſpenſatory Kingdom of Chriſt: Do you act pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Godly ſorrow; for they are but for the time of this life, and then they ſhall ceaſe. And the way by which the life of grace is now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſhall be no more: therefore get what benefit you can by them while you do enjoy them. So it is alſo in the permitting will of God; give God the glory of it, during the time of the acting thereof: it is but for the dayes of thy vanity and no more, therefore be content to ſubmit unto it.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55318:133"/>
            <p n="5">5. From the glorious ends that God doth accompliſh by his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby the grace of Chriſt is magnified, and the Saints have a continual ground for recourſe unto the fountain for the waſhing of ſin and uncleanneſs, becauſe the Lord leaves them unto daily defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby his mercy is exalted in pardoning their ſcandalous fals, and reſtoring them again after they have to the utmoſt deſtroyed themſelves, and that they ſhall gain as it were a new converſion thereby. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hereby a conſtant war is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and a mans Crown ſhall be proportioned to his combat. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora certamina majora ſequntur prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi> A mans greateſt enemy is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the ſoreſt battails are fought betwixt Fleſh and Spirit in the ſame heart. For the power of grace as well as of Corruption is mainly drawn out by oppoſition; <hi>Gratia
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55318:134"/>vexata ſeipſam prodit.</hi> Hereby we have experience of Chriſt our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pleading our cauſe before the Throne of grace, and rebuking Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan our accuſer: as he is brought in, Zach. 3.1, 2. <hi>The Lord rebuke thee; the Lord that hath choſen</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>rebuke thee.</hi> And hereby when Chriſt and the Saints ſhall judge the world, the laſt act of the Kingdom of Chriſt will be ſo much the more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hereby we ſhall be purged from thoſe remainders of defilement; for <hi>this is all the fruit, to take away their ſin,</hi> Iſa. 27.9. when the Saints are left under the power of ungodly men, it is but to try them, and to purge them, and make them white <hi>unto the time of the end,</hi> Dan. 11.35.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This will ſweeten heaven for ever. The conſideration of all thoſe miſeries we are delivered from, which by the permiſſion of God we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of.</p>
            <p>We now come to the fruit and conſequence of ſuch a temper of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſubmitting to the will of God;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55318:134"/>which is expreſſed in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we ceaſed. This word is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly uſed both in ſacred and profane Authors, and I find in them all that it commonly ſignifies theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An inward quietneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind; for there is a ſilence of the ſoul, Pſalm 62.1. <hi>My ſoul, keep ſilence unto God.</hi> Therefore it is for a man to be quiet without any inward turnings or riſings of ſpirit, to have a ſpirit quiet like the calm ſea; a man that is delivered from an unquiet ſpirit, and freed from thoſe turbulent affections that do diſquiet other men; therefore the Septuagint do thus render the word, to which interpretation we are moſt to give heed in the interpretation of the word in the New Teſtament. In <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is good for a man to wait quietly:</hi> the word is the ſame with that in my text. It is an inward qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs of Spirit in <hi>waiting for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.11. ſtudy to be quiet. Make it your ambition to get an inward quiet calm ſpirit;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55318:135"/>look upon it as matter of your duty and of your Glory to attain ſuch a ſpirit that you may be free from all turbulent inward diſtractions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The word ſignifies a ſilence of ſpeech as well as a ſilence of ſoul, Nehem. 5.8. <hi>So they held their peace,</hi> (ſo the Septuagint render it) they had not a word to anſwer, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. When <hi>Peter</hi> declared to the Church the converſion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>they held their peace and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The word ſignifies a quiet beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, a Ceſſation from work, as a man without buſineſs, or (as one tranſlates it) it is as much as to keep holy day. So it is rendred, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.56. and I think all theſe three ſenſes are meant here: and then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this.</p>
            <p>When we underſtood that this was the mind and will of God that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> our minds were quiet under that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; we ſpake no more againſt it; they acted no more that they might turn <hi>Paul</hi> from it.</p>
            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:55318:135"/>
            <p>And in all theſe ſenſes I conceive the word is here to be taken, that their minds are quieted and calmed under the diſpenſations of God; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord would have it ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do forbear either to ſpeak or to act againſt it.</p>
            <p>So that the Obſervations are three, according to the word's threefold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>A mans heart being once truly and fully concluded under the will of God, there doth follow in the ſoul a ſweet peace and holy tranquillity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> a great inward quietneſs of mind.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>The mind being thus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, doth ſilence the tongue, that a man dares not ſpeak againſt ſuch diſpenſations of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>The ſoul being thus ſweetly calmed under the will of God, dares not act in any thing tumultuouſly in a way of oppoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:55318:136"/>
            <p>So it was with theſe men here, they held their peace, they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to diſſwade <hi>Paul,</hi> or to do any thing that might hinder him from the enterprize which they ſaw it was the will of God he ſhould undertake, what difficulty or hardſhip ſoever he under-went in it, or whatever the ſucceſs of the work may be.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>An heart once truly and fully concluded under the will of God, there doth follow an holy tranquillity, a bleſſed quietneſs and ſerenity of mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of it, I will ſhew you,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there is a quietneſs and tranquillity in the inward man, which every heart is to labour for, for ſerenity as well as ſincerity in the inward parts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That its the concluding of our will unto the will of God, that is the only ground of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What there is in this ſubmiſſion of our wils to Gods will
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55318:136"/>that is a ground of this inward quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the application hereof to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is an holy quietneſs and tranquillity which every Saint is to labour for. I ſay, an holy quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind: For there is a ſinful quietneſs, which is a ſin, and the fruit of ſin proceeding from ſenſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity, when mens hearts within them are as a ſtone, like the dead ſea moved at nothing; when men <hi>dwell without care,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.8. and <hi>hear the Word of the Lord, ye careleſs Daughters,</hi> Iſa. 32.9. when men are not troubled or afflicted with any thing. As there is an evil conſcience which is <hi>pacatamala,</hi> and that man is in the moſt danger of all, being in judgement given over to a ſpirit of ſlumber; ſo there is in the mind in reſpect of all the dealings of God, a ſinful quietneſs from a careleſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. As there is a natural patience in ſome, and a kind of natural meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is not a grace, but a ſin,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55318:137"/>as all the natural vertues of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were; And therefore <hi>Lipſius</hi> doth pray, <hi>Da mihi patientiam Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anam.</hi> So there is a natural quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit proceeding ever from careleſneſs and ſtupidity; Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being of ſuch a temper they can be troubled at nothing. But this is not that quietneſs of an heart that muſt be grounded upon the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our wils to Gods will, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on known rules of duty.</p>
            <p>This <hi>David</hi> cals upon his ſoul for, Pſalm 116.7. <hi>Return unto thy reſt, oh my ſoul.</hi> Which ſome expound of God, who is indeed all in all to his people, their reſting, their dwelling place.</p>
            <p>But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> takes reſt here to be put <hi>pro tranquillo &amp; bene compoſito ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi ſtatu.</hi> He had been in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, the ſorrows of death had compaſſed him, and the pains of hell took hold of him, and there had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in his ſoul great perplexity and unquietneſs; he now cals off his ſoul from thoſe unquiet motions and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Spirit, to return to reſt,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55318:137"/>to a calm, quiet, ſerene frame again. This is a diſtemper of Spirit, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid complains of, Pſalm 38.10. <hi>Circumivit cor meum,</hi> my heart went up and down, to and fro, like a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; it was in a continual unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, never ſetled or at a ſtay. So Pſalm 43.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>fremuit, tumultuatus eſt.</hi> His Soul was in a tumult, he had an uproar in his own ſpirit: which Chriſt expreſſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.29. by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Be you not as a Meteor, which is not faſtned in any orb, but ſubject to various, doubtfull and uncertain motions: This is to live in careful ſuſpenſe; a Chriſtian ſhould labour for ſetled mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirit, as the fixed ſtars. This is the frame of Spirit which is in the ſight of God of great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. Let there be what troubles there will below, they ſhall not reach the ſoul to diſquiet it, though they may the outward condition, yet the ſoul is kept as the upper region of the air, alwayes ſerene without clouds.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55318:138"/>This did <hi>Habakuck</hi> obtain, Chap. 3.9. <hi>He maketh my feet like Hinds feet;</hi> that is, to walk with eaſe and fearleſneſs, <hi>per montes, per rupta,</hi> though thoſe wayes of difficulty would have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted other men; <hi>And he ſets me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on high places,;</hi> that is, <hi>Libere &amp; abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que metu incedere in locis excelſis:</hi> that be the difficulties what they will be, yet he is as man that is ſet aloft out of Gunſhot, he doth not fear; his mind is no more diſquieted by it then he would be that is out of the reach of danger. This is a qualification of ſpirit which every Chriſtian ſhould labour for, and we ſee by this inſtance may be obtained; that as the Saints in heaven, whatſoever the Lord doth pleaſeth them, becauſe their wils are moulded and framed into his will, therefore they are not diſquieted at any of his dealings; ſo we ſhould ſtrive in our meaſure to attain ſuch a frame of heart, thereby to keep a conſtant calmneſs and ſerenity of Spirit, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the dealings of God be toward us, or in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the ſoul of man is brought
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55318:138"/>into a full and perfect ſubjection to the will of God, then is there a conſtant qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and tranquillity maintained in it, which will appear by theſe demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin did invade the throne of God, and ſinful ſelf having as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed God in the ſoul, now takes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the Godhead, ſo that all the ſubjections that be due to God, ſinful ſelf doth claim. <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.3. Now the honour of God is, that his will ſhould rule in the world; all things are created by his will, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. ult. And by the ſame will all things muſt be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. So long there fore as ſelf is the God in the man, ſo long an oppoſition will be maintained by ſelf in the ſoul againſt God. So far as ſelf is depoſed, ſo far God is exalted; when ſelf ſhall be perfectly depoſed, then ſhall God be exalted alone; but in this life ſo far as there are remainders of ſelf in the man, there will be oppoſition maintained againſt God. And this oppoſition muſt needs be the greater, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55318:139"/>the thing is that is contended for. If two Kings contend for a Crown, it will cauſe a great deal of diſturbance in the Kingdom. And this is the ground of the fight between the fleſh and the ſpirit, in the ſoul of the Saint: fleſh contends for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Self, and Grace for the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of God; each of them ſtrive for a Godhead, therefore their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs be exceeding great.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin is nothing elſe but the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mans will to Gods will, and this is properly a ſeat of ſin, Rom. 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity to God, it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither can be.</hi> For as Corruption doth deifie reaſon in a way of wiſdom, ſo it doth deifie the will in a way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and loves not to have any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over it, that may controll, correct or reſtrain it. Therefore men look upon the Law of God as <hi>cords and bands</hi> which they cannot bear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3. But they kick at them with the feet of pride and contempt. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground it is that every unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man is called a turbulent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55318:139"/>ſpirited man, never at peace and reſt within himſelf, becauſe of the oppoſition of his will to the will of God. Though therefore there may be ſome velity wrought upon the will of unregenerate men, an imperfect and incompleat will, that they may hear gladly, and do many things, yet there is ſome point of ſtrictneſs in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unregenerate mans caſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſet home upon him, he ſtumbles at it, and ſaith, <hi>Durus eſt hic ſermo:</hi> his will ſtands out, and the treaty betwixt him and God thereupon breaks off. Therefore there is many a man that goes far, parts with much, comes to an <hi>almoſt I am perſwaded to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> but yet in the very ultimate act of Regeneration, he plaies the part of <hi>an unwiſe ſon, and ſtayes in the place of the breaking forth of Children,</hi> Hoſ. 13.13. and ſo is never new born to God. Thus all the unquietneſs of the ſpirit, and the offence that a man takes at the Commands &amp; wayes of God, proceeds from nothing elſe but the non-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his will to the will of God; were that brought about, that a man
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55318:140"/>had <hi>reſpect unto all the Commandments,</hi> the work were done, and all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of the ſoul taken away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The will of God is the Center of all the wills of the Creature, unto which they are all created and ordained to act and move. There is a double motion or tendency of the creature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the will of God. One is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; ſo the Creatures without reaſon move toward it; for they are all his ſervants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.91. But as for reaſonable creatures, God doth act them according to their nature in a voluntary way, and ſo the will of God is the center of their will. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are therefore ſaid to <hi>do his pleaſure,</hi> and to <hi>harken to the voice of his word,</hi> Pſalm 103.20. So the Saints; David <hi>my ſervant hath fulfilled all my wills,</hi> Acts 13.22. Now if any thing be taken from its Center, it is unquiet, moves diſorderly and with a diſturbed motion. Let the needle that is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Loadſtone, be ſhaken from its place, it is alwayes trembling and unquiet, till it return to the place of its former reſt. Let any earthly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55318:140"/>be by the heat of the ſun exhaled, and we ſee how it is toſt to and fro in the air till the earthly matter with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence return again unto its center. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is at quiet out of its proper place. The waters are made naturally to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the earth, but God hath by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree laid them up in heaps; he hath laid up the deep as in a treaſure-houſe; hence comes all the unquietneſs and turbulency that is in the vaſt body of the ſea. So it is with the ſoul of a man in a voluntary way, as it is with the creatures in a natural way. God is the center to which it was created, and it is alway unquiet, till it reſt there. <hi>Inquietum eſt cor meum, donec requieſcat in te.</hi> Auſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The will of man in a ſtate of ſin is not only in an oppoſition to the will of God, but to it ſelf alſo. <hi>The wills of the fleſh and of the mind,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. There are <hi>divers luſts and pleaſures, Titus</hi> 3.3. and they do very often fall croſs and contrary one to another; and <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters</hi> that give croſs and contrary commands, without a great deal of trouble and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55318:141"/>diſturbance. That which will grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a mans pride, will not ſerve his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and that which will fit his ſenſual ty, will not ſuit with his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: <hi>Scelera diſsident,</hi> the Heathen man obſerves. As all truths agree among themſelves, ſo do all duties; but <hi>Error multiplex,</hi> Corrupt doctrines may, and do croſs one with another, and ſo do alſo corrupt wayes. Now when the ſoul of man is deſirous to pleaſe and content them all, he would ſerve them all, it is no wonder if the man be in a continual unquietneſs in his own ſpirit. If the water did alway run one way, it would run ſmoothly; but when the tide comes in, and the waters in their ſtreams croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the waves are lifted up, each one tending to their own motion.</p>
            <p>This ſaid to be a mans wife, or we are ſaid to be married to ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. now if a man had many wives, and he uxorious and deſiring to pleaſe them all, and they have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſires and oppoſite wills, the man ſhould never be quiet either in his houſe or heart. And ſuch an uxorious
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55318:141"/>husband every ſinner is, that though every man hath ſome darling, ſome <hi>Dalilah</hi> that he would chiefly pleaſe, there yet is an unquietneſs in him all the while, becauſe he doth diſpleaſe the reſt of his Paramours.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the guidance of the Saints, and therefore they are ſaid to be <hi>led by the Spirit.</hi> Chriſt gives us a manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the preſence of the Father by way of mediation. <hi>By him we have</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>an acceſs to the Father,</hi> Epheſ. 3.12. But the Spirit gives us a manuduction in point of direction in our whole courſe. Now the Spirit works in the ſoul, in a ſweet and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way. When a man receives the Spirit, he is <hi>annoynted with the oyl of gladneſs,</hi> Pſalm 45.7. it makes him go readily and chearfully on. <hi>Non tardat uncta rota: Draw us, and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1.4. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſaid to draw, becauſe its motion is powerful; and yet we are ſaid to run, becauſe our motion is voluntary. <hi>Trahitur animus &amp; amore:</hi> There are no cords that draw ſo effectually as the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55318:142"/>cords of Love. Now the guidance of this Spirit is wholly according to the will of God. As he <hi>doth make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion in us according to the will of God,</hi> ſo he doth work ſubjection in us according unto the will of God. And when the ſoul is brought into a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, then all contention ceaſeth. <hi>Subordinata non pugnant.</hi> Now every unregenerate man being acted by the ſpirit of Satan, doth act in a way of oppoſition; Satan being a turbulent and unquiet ſpirit, never at reſt, goes about like a roaring Lion, is alway compaſſing the earth; therefore where he bears rule, the ſoul is full of unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, and for ever reſtleſs. When an evil ſpirit came upon <hi>Saul,</hi> how unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et was he continually! As the man poſſeſſed with the Devil, there were no chains could hold him; he dwels among the tombs, he doth continually cut and wound himſelf. So it is with the ſoul in whom Satan rules, becauſe he acts it in wayes of oppoſition unto the will of God. If the Lord would give Satan leave, and give him power of the winds, he would raiſe nothing but
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55318:142"/>tempeſts and thunders, and bluſtering in the world; as appears, Job 1.19. <hi>there came a wind from the wilderneſs and ſmote the four corners of his houſe.</hi> We hear of Witches that ſell winds to Merchants by the permiſſion of God. If the Lord would give Satan leave and power over the ſoul, he would raiſe nothing but winds and tempeſts there. If the Lord would ſuffer him to blow upon the great ſea of corruption, that is, the man, there would be nothing but waves and billows; for he loves nothing more then to diſturb and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the ſoul, becauſe he acts men in oppoſition unto the will of God, whereas the Spirit of God acts them ſweetly and quietly, becauſe it is in wayes of ſubordination thereunto.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It doth plainly appear in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the ſoul of the creature is ſubjected fully unto the will of God, there is no diſquietneſs in any thing which either the Lord commands or effects, but a conſtant calmneſs and ſerenity of Spirit. We ſee it in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo long as he continued in his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in a conformity to God, in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55318:143"/>and holineſs of truth, and his will ſubjected unto the will of God in all things, he had none of thoſe diſquieting affections at any thing commanded or wrought by God; he was able to delight himſelf in the whole law of God, and rejoyce in all the works of his hands. And ſo it is with the Saints in glory, the ſouls of <hi>juſt men made perfect,</hi> they freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto Gods commanding will, and they do truly rejoice in his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and permitting will, becauſe their will is wholly melted into the will of God, and they have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt apart from God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever he do, pleaſeth them. <hi>They take pleaſure in all his works,</hi> Pſal. 111.2, 3. And the ſame is true of the Angels, they obey his voice, they do his pleaſure without any unquietneſs or reluctance. <hi>They go and come like lightning,</hi> Ezech. 1.19. <hi>The Angel</hi> Gabriel <hi>did fly ſwiftly,</hi> Dan. 10. They do it ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they do it chearfully. Were there nor a conformity in their will unto the will of God, this could not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55318:143"/>be. For that is the ground of all the droopings of the Saints in all their ſervices; they drive heavily becauſe their will is not fully ſubjected unto the will of the Lord. So it was in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he had the will of God manifeſted towards him in the moſt unpleaſing manner to fleſh, for he muſt deny the will of nature, and that muſt ſtoop unto the will of duty, and yet if it be to take fleſh with the infirmities thereof, that in that nature he might lay down his life, he ſaith, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O God.</hi> He had no unquietneſs of ſpirit in him from a principle of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, though in point of ſatisfaction he ſaith, <hi>My ſoul is heavy unto death.</hi> Therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. he is ſaid <hi>to be girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</hi> Though I conceive Chriſt doth appear in heaven as he is the Churches high Prieſt, <hi>Amictu Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotali.</hi> And among other prieſtly ornaments, the <hi>curious girdle</hi> is one, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.39. yet I conceive they had all a ſpiritual ſignification, and this doth note the ſuppreſſing of all
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55318:144"/>inordinate motions and affections in the ſoul. It is ſaid, <hi>Juſtice and Faithfulneſs ſhould be the girdle of his reins,</hi> Iſa. 11.6. But it is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be about his paps. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Brightman</hi> gives the reaſon, becauſe under the Law there being leſs grace poured out, the luſts of men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in a more legal way, by principle; of fear, <hi>Coercebantur cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate.</hi> But under the Goſpel, more grace being poured out, the breaſts being the ſeat of Love, all unrulineſs and unquietneſs of Spirit being in a way of love ſuppreſt and kept under, therefore he is not ſaid to be girded about the loins, but about the paps with a golden girdle. After the ſame manner alſo it is ſpoken of the Saints; for there was not only a girdle made for <hi>Aaron,</hi> but for his ſons alſo. So were the Saints to be girt about the breaſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.6. They do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the ſame honour with him, and grace in them hath the ſame power over them. Thus we ſee that when the will of man is brought into a full and compleat ſubjection to the will of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55318:144"/>God, then all unquiet and unruly paſſions and motions in the ſoul are done away, and there follows an holy calmneſs and tranquillity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, all unquietneſs ariſing from no other ground but the oppoſition that is in our will unto the will of God; we would have our will ſtand, and not Gods will; and becauſe his will doth croſs ours, therefore our ſpirit is full of tumult and diſorder.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is there in the ſubjecting of our wills unto the will of God that can be a ground of this inward quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tranquillity of mind?</p>
            <p>There are two things that are the main cauſes of all diſquiet in the ſoul; diſquieting reaſonings in a way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation, and tormenting riſings in a way of paſſion. Now our ſubjection of our wills unto the will of God, doth calm the raging ſeas in a man in both theſe, and then there muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a great calm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are in the ſoul diſquieting reaſonings which do proceed from a mans fleſhly will. For reaſon in the man is the Wills privy Counſellor,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55318:145"/>whoſe directions and dictates it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and while the will is unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the man is full of diſputings and gainſayings: ſometimes againſt the Counſel of God, his decreeing will, Rom. 9. <hi>Seeing he hardens whom he will, and we cannot help it,</hi> becauſe <hi>none can reſiſt his will, why doth he yet find fault,</hi> and lay the blame upon us? Sometimes againſt his commanding will. When the Lord commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to go to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> he objects, how ſhall I go to <hi>Pharoah? I am a man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And ſo it is againſt the permitting will of God. <hi>Lord, why do the wicked proſper, and wherefore are they happy that deal trecherouſly?</hi> Jer. 12.1. <hi>Wherefore lookeſt thou on, and holdeſt thy tongue, when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous then he, and makeſt men like the fiſhes of the Sea that have no ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler?</hi> Hab. 1.13, 14. <hi>O quam ſapiens ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentatrix ſibi videtur arrogantia hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana, praeſertim cum aliquid de gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis metuit amittere!</hi> Tert. And theſe kind of reaſonings fill the ſoul with abundance of diſquiet, when the heart of man ſhall dare riſe up againſt the will of God, diſputing againſt the equity of it, ſaying, <hi>The Lords wayes are not equal.</hi> But when once the will of man is concluded under the will of God, then the reaſonings of the ſoul are calmed; the fleſhly wiſdom diſputes no more, but obeyes. As the poor woman in the book of Martyrs, ſaid, I cannot diſpute, but I can burn. So the Chriſtian ſaith, I cannot
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55318:146"/>diſpute, but I can obey; upon this ground, becauſe it is the will of God: <hi>Arrogantiam exiſtimo de bono divini praecepti diſputare; nee quia bonum eſt oſcultare debemus, ſed quia Deus praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</hi> There be two difficult com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that God gave to <hi>Abraham;</hi> one <hi>to forſake his Country and his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and to go into a Land in which he was a ſtranger.</hi> But it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord called him to his foot,</hi> Iſa. 41.2. that is, ſubdued his heart unto the call, to follow the Lord in all the wayes in which he ſhould go before him. Though he might have much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, yet the ſubjection of his will did ſilence his reaſon, and ſuppreſſed his diſquieting thoughts, which otherwiſe might have riſen within him. Then the Lord gave him another command, to <hi>offer his ſon, his only ſon.</hi> Much might have been ſaid againſt it from the Law of God, &amp; the light of Nature; but his will being concluded under the will of God, it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he ſtaggered not,</hi> he did not diſpute it <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> with himſelf, but the will of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55318:146"/>manifeſted, immediatly he did obey, and roſe up early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſervice to which he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: It is ſaid of all the Saints, Deut. 33.3. that <hi>they ſit down at the Lords feet to receive his</hi> word. It is an expreſſion after the manner of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars among the Jews, they ſate down at the feet of their Tutors, as <hi>Paul</hi> did at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> And they are not to diſpute their Inſtructions, but receive them. So it is with the Saints, when the will of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, they are not to argue, but to believe. And when the will of man is concluded under the will of God, it is upon theſe two principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A man receives all things from Gods will as wiſe, for it is a will guided by Counſel: He doth not work barely by will, as men many times do, but he <hi>works all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Counſel of his will,</hi> Epheſ. 1.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He looks upon it as good It is <hi>the good and acceptable will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2. good in it ſelf, and good to us, even the rule of goodneſs: whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55318:147"/>the ſoul receives the will of God under theſe notions, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that diſquieting reaſonings in the ſoul muſt be ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſoul is ſtrangely diſquieted by tormenting paſſions. The affections of men are of two ſorts; ſome are chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting, as Love, Hope, Joy; ſome are afflicting, as anger, ſorrow and fear: therefore when in Scripture a man is commanded <hi>to afflict his ſoul,</hi> the meaning is, to raiſe up and to act in his ſoul theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting affections; for it is by them that the ſoul is diſquieted, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Therefore in heaven, though the affections themſelves ſhall not ceaſe, becauſe they are of the nature of the immortal ſoul, yet all the acts of them ſhall ceaſe, that a man ſhall never ſorrow more, never fear more. As in hell all the chearing affections of the ſoul in their actings ſhall ceaſe, a man ſhall never love more, hope more, joy more. Now in the ſouls of juſt men made perfect in heaven, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from the actings of theſe tormenting affections, there is nothing
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55318:147"/>that doth or can diſquiet them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt needs be a continual calm. Theſe onely cloud the ſouls of men below; now if all the clouds were removed and diſpelled, there would be nothing to hinder the ſun in its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from ſhining conſtantly forth. So it would be with the ſoul, at quiet, and at peace, when all the affections that diſtract and diſquiet it, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Now when the ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under the will of God, it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted by none of theſe. For he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to do the commanding will of God. It is the joy of his heart, his meat and drink. He delights to be under the effecting will of God in what kind ſoever. <hi>Si vis conſtituere me Paſtorem ovium, aut Regem Populo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum ecceparatum eſt Cor meum.</hi> He can <hi>ſing in a priſon, take with joy the ſpoiling of his goods,</hi> and chearfully part with his choiceſt relations. <hi>Per calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum perge patrem, ficcis oculis ad vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illum Crucis evola.</hi> He is never vexed with tormenting cares. <hi>We are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter.</hi> For he hath <hi>caſt all his care upon him that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55318:148"/>careth for him.</hi> If he be called before Rulers, <hi>he takes no thought what he ſhall anſwer,</hi> or what the event or ſucceſs ſhall be, <hi>it ſhall be given you in that hour.</hi> He is not diſquieted with vexing fears. <hi>I will not fear what man can do unto me. Though an hoaſt of men were encamped about me, I will not fear.</hi> What ever befals him in the way of duty, <hi>Fides famem non timet.</hi> The inſtance of <hi>Luther</hi> in going to <hi>Worms</hi> to the diſputation, makes that manifeſt. I will enter <hi>Worms</hi> in the name of the Lord, though there were as many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils as there are tiles upon the houſes. He is never tormented with thoughts of deſpair. But he ſaith, <hi>though I fall, I ſhall riſe, though I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord will be a light about me. I ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi> Now a man that never grieves, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fears, never cares, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this man from a conſtant calmneſs and ſerenity within himſelf? Now when our will is ſubdued unto the will of God, all theſe diſquieting paſſions muſt be ſubdued upon a double ground.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſoul doth conclude
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55318:148"/>that Gods will is Gods pleaſure. When Chriſt did the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is ſaid, <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. Now nothing ſhould grieve me, but that which grieves the Lord; I ſhould fear nothing but that which offends him, I ſhould be angry for nothing, but what diſpleaſeth him. Now all the Acts of his will, he is pleaſed with them, therefore I ſhould be quieted under them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the will of God be my end, the will of God ſhall be my reward. God hath made over all his attributes to his people in that glorious promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God;</hi> and anſwerable to a mans obedience to any Attribute, ſuch ſhall his comfort that comes from that Attribute be. And if I work for Gods will, ſurely the ſame will, will in all things work for me, and the Lord will do nothing but what ſhall be as truly for my good, as it is for his own glory. And therefore the ſoul is not angry at any thing that God will do: is not vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſquieted at any thing, but ſits down under it with a holy tranquillity
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55318:149"/>of mind. For his commanding will he ſaith, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Jube quod vis.</hi> For his effecting will he ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeems good in his eyes.</hi> The world is his great houſe, and the Government of it belongs to him, <hi>the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Let this ſerve by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to preſs the former Doctrine that we be perfectly concluded under the will of God from this bleſſed fruit and effect thereof, that it will free us from that unquietneſs of mind which is the great miſery the Saints groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For as we ſhould truly ſtrive to keep peace with God, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace with men, ſo we ſhould alſo ſtrive to maintain a peace in our own ſpirits. For in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo Chriſt is <hi>the Prince of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to inforce this Exhortation, I ſhall firſt ſhew you the ſinfulneſs of an unquiet ſpirit under any of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The dangerous uſe that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55318:149"/>the Devil makes of ſuch a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What excellency there is in a calm and a quiet mind.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How ſuch a frame of ſpirit may be obtained.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſinfulneſs of an unquiet ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby thou ſinneſt againſt thine own ſoul. That is the expreſſion, Numbers 16. <hi>They are ſinners againſt their own ſouls.</hi> Now the ſoul of man in its creation was ſuch for the glory of it, that the ſun in its brightneſs is not to be compared to it. But there is a double excellency in the ſoul, in wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the beauty and the glory of it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In its purity, and ſo ſin fights againſt the ſoul, for it defiles it, which nothing but ſin could have done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the ſerenity, and ſo ſin hath diſquieted and diſturbed the ſoul, which nothing elſe could have done. Do not deſtroy your own ſouls; and the ſoul is deſtroyed either by the polluting of it, or by the diſquieting of it, which is of that value and worth,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55318:150"/>that all things below ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beneath it, as that which is too little to ranſom a ſoul. All the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not worth one diſquieting thought of the ſoul, it is of ſo great an excellency. And the greater the ſin is, becauſe a man himſelf is the inſtruemnt thereof. To trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, torment himſelf, be a burthen to himſelf, as every unquiet ſpirited man is, Pſalm 43.4, 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul, and why art thou diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted within me?</hi> There are two words uſed, the one ſignifies to lay a thing waſt as a wilderneſs, as void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as if a man were in a barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where there is nohing to be had to refreſh him: But how comes the ſoul to be thus like a deſolate howling Wilderneſs? the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that he himſelf was the inſtrument thereof, the means of the devaſtation of his own Spirit: And the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to proſtrate a thing, depreſs it to the very ground, which word is in ſuch a conjugation, and doth ſignifie that the man did caſt down himſelf; the ſoul is the inſtrument in its own
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55318:150"/>dejection. All murther is ſinfull, but no murther ſo great an evil, or ſo uncomfortable as ſelf-murther, and no ſelf-murther, like unto ſoul-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for a man to go about to debaſe and bring down the glory of his ſoul, which he ſhould endeavor to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie with the higheſt qualifications, and look upon it as his only glory; for the qualifications of the ſoul are the only excellencies of the man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A man may take a meaſure of the ſinfulneſs of his ſpirit, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs of it; for the unquietneſs of the ſpirit doth proceed wholly from the oppoſition of the will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of God. Now as the power of Godlineſs doth lie in the ſubjection of our wills unto Gods will, that when grace ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in glory, there ſhall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſubjection; ſo the power of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs lies in the oppoſition of our wills unto Gods will; and the more fully thou ſtandeſt in oppoſition, the greater is the meaſure of thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: If therefore unquietneſs of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55318:151"/>ſpirit doth riſe from oppoſition of will, then the more unquietneſs there is, the greater oppoſition: The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil being in the higheſt oppoſition unto God, and they that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it being direct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; whereas other ſinners are but enemies to God in a collateral way: their oppoſition is the greateſt, being revenge againſt God, doing deſpight unto the ſpirit of grace; therefore they are moſt unquiet. Though in a temptation, there is an unquietneſs of ſpirit, that may ariſe upon the beſt men, as it did upon <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionah;</hi> yet if that be a mans ordinary and conſtant temper, it argues he hath much of the devil in him: the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and melting of a mans ſpirit into the will of God is the meaſure of his grace; and the oppoſition of a mans will unto the will of God, and his unquietneſs thereupon, is the meaſure of his corruption. Men that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fiery, and <hi>ad oppoſitum,</hi> now this doth not pleaſe them; and now they fret at this inſtrument, and by and by are diſcontented at that diſpenſation.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55318:151"/>If <hi>Niniveh</hi> be not deſtroyed, <hi>Ionah</hi> is angry; if the Gourd be not ſpared, he is angry; it is an argument there is but a little grace, and a great deal of corruption. And as grace doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſubduing the will unto the will of God; ſo ſurely will the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a mans ſpirit increaſe. Grace in a man ripens as fruit doth; at firſt, there is a great deal of ſourneſs and ſharpneſs mixed with it, but then it is green; the riper it grows, the more mellow and the more ſweet it is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The more pride there is in any ſin, the greater that ſin is; for to ſin againſt God with a high hand, is proudly to ſin againſt him. Now as humility is the meaſure of all grace, ſo pride is the meaſure of all ſin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>David</hi> doth expreſs preſumptuous ſins, which are in degree next the great tranſgreſſion, by a word which ſignifies <hi>Ab inſolentibus:</hi> ſo <hi>Montanus, Ab ſuperbiis,</hi> ſo others. Now is there a higher pride in the world then this, for a man to ſtand it out with God, Whether Gods will
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55318:152"/>or his will ſhall ſtand? Whether God ſhall command as he pleaſeth, or I obey as I pleaſe? Whether God ſhall Rule the world, or I ſhall rule the world? Either what will pleaſe God, or what will pleaſe men? And therefore the Prophet reſolves all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto the will of God, unto this, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.17. <hi>If you will not hear, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret for your pride.</hi> There cannot be a higher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of pride in any of the ſons of pride then this, therefore the greater the ſin is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This ſhews that there is but little dominion, or authority, that grace hath in the ſoul: Grace ſets up the Kingdom of Chriſt in the heart where it is, and Chriſts kingdom is mainly exerciſed over the ſpirits of men: <hi>It is not in meat and drink, but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> therefore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. It is ſaid, <hi>He that rules his ſpirit, is better than he that wins a City.</hi> Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtrive for authority, though few uſe it well when they have it; there is a government, that all ſhould
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55318:152"/>exerciſe a rule over your own ſpirits. Now ſo much grace as there is in any man, ſo much authority and rule that man hath over his own ſoul: he that hath no rule in himſelf, but it breaks forth into contention and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order upon all occaſions, that man hath no grace in him. Grace calls firſt for a wel-ordered ſoul, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for a well-ordered converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if it be ſo great a matter to rule the tongue, that <hi>he that ſeems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, that mans Religion is in vain;</hi> it is much more to rule the ſpirit, to ſet up the government of Chriſt in the inward man.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is the Devils way of ſinning, and it is the Judgement he is given up unto, he is a reſtleſs and unquiet ſpirit, goes about like a roaring Lion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acting in oppoſition unto God in way of revenge, always fretting at the diſpenſations of God, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33. <hi>He ſeeks reſt, and he finds none:</hi> Ever reſtleſs under any of Gods dealings; and this is his Judgement, and the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55318:153"/>greateſt torment that now he hath (beſide <hi>a certain expectation of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) that the Lord hath given him over to a ſpirit of oppoſition, and that in a conſtant and a reſtleſs way; and this is the Devils Hell. <hi>Tolle propriam voluntatem &amp; non erit infernus.</hi> So <hi>Bernard,</hi> therefore on the contrary, <hi>Uno poſito ponitur &amp; alterum.</hi> Set up a mans will againſt Gods will, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him over thereunto, and it will be an hell unto that man.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a fearfull Iudgement from the Lord, for to be as the troubled ſea, that cannot reſt, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.20. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, unto the wicked.</hi> It is ſpoken upon occaſion of the return of the people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as appears <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <hi>Caſt, caſt ye up, prepare the way of my people, take away the ſtumbling block: the Lord will not contend for ever, neither will he be alway wrath.</hi> Being returned, the Lord doth promiſe to ſend them the Goſpel, the Meſſengers of Peace, the Miniſters of God ſhall now ſpeak peace to them, who did before ſpeak error, and the fruit of it ſhall be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55318:153"/>a conſtant peace and quietneſs in their own conſciences; for <hi>God would create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace.</hi> The repetition notes <hi>excellentiam ſeu abundantiam,</hi> Ier. 7.4. <hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Temple, where the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth his preſence ſhould be for ever, and it ſhould be called by his name, Iſa. 28.16. <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion,</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſad, Muſad, <hi>a foundation, a foundation;</hi> a glorious, an excellent, a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: And the repetition alſo notes, <hi>Continuationem.</hi> Deut. 16.20. <hi>That which is Juſtice, Juſtice ſhalt thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</hi> That is <hi>indeſinenter ſectaberis:</hi> Thou ſhalt wholly, conſtantly, and continually follow that which is juſt. So here he will create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, it notes a glorious and an eminent peace that God would give them in their own ſpirits; and it ſhould be a conſtant &amp; a ſetled peace, not to be diſquieted any more: But after this return when the Lord ſhould ſpeak this peace to his own people, yet the hearts of wicked men ſhould have no peace, they ſhould be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55318:154"/>like the raging ſea that cannot reſt. It notes their own inward unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Affectibus ſuis &amp; afflatu malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Spirituum agitati floret.</hi> After they are returned out of the captivity, and there was peace to the Saints, even then there ſhould be no peace to the wicked. Though they be not diſquieted by enemies, as winds from without, yet as the Sea they ſhall diſquiet themſelves by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions and eſtuations. There is an offence that men take ſometimes at the word of God, ſometimes at the works of God. At his word, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.9. There is a path that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſhall walk in, and tranſgreſſors ſhall fall in. There are ſome paſſages in the word, that the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do ſometimes ſtumble at <hi>in ſcandalum: This is a hard ſaying, who can hear it;</hi> but ungodly men ſtumble at them <hi>in ruinam.</hi> There are alſo ſome works of God, at which men are offended, ſtumbling Providences: either when they are above mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, <hi>the wheels being lifted up from the earth;</hi> or beyond mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55318:154"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. <hi>When perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ariſeth for the words ſake, by and by they are offended.</hi> So Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.6. both in reſpect of his word and works, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> There are as great ſnares of Satan, and as great Judgements of God laid in ſcandals, as in any thing in the world beſide; and therefore men ought to take heed how they take offence, becauſe there is a bait in it, in which they may in judgement be inſnared and taken. It is an obſervation much to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that if Satan woul inſtill in the hearts of men any evil impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning any truth of God, he doth uſually bring it in by ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God that men may take offence at; we ſee it in the <hi>Gaderens Math</hi> 8.31. <hi>If thou caſt us out, ſuffer us to go into the heard of ſwine. Ut eos ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur a porcorum ad maledicendum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto impelleret,</hi> that they may never deſire his company, and preaching more that brought ſo great a loſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and though it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils deſire; yet the Lord doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55318:155"/>grant it, as he did his requeſt againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> for his owne juſt and great ends, thereby to try and prove the obedience of the Saints; ſuch works are a ſtumbling block unto ungodly men: and thereby a great difference is put betwixt them and others. It is as great a judgment to ſtumble at the works as it is at the word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to conſider the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous uſe that the devil makes of an unquiet ſpirit; he loves it, being unto him a ſutable habitation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Let not the ſun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devill.</hi> If once a mans ſpirit be in a diſturbed frame, there is a doore ſet open for Satan to enter at, and the uſe that he doth make of ſuch a frame of ſpirit is commonly this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He doth hereby keep the ſoul in a continual tumult, that a man ſhall not be able to make a ſupplication unto God: it ſhall diſturb him in all his duties. See it in <hi>Jonah, ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. when his ſpirit was in an unquiet frame, ſee what an angry pecviſh prayer he made, and offers up unto
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55318:155"/>God. No man is fit to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, that hath not the command of his own ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another uſe the devil makes of it is this, to imbitter a man againſt God, and all the Inſtruments that God doth uſe. This we finde to be in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord departed from</hi> Saul, <hi>and an evil ſpirit from the Lord vexed him:</hi> So that all the actions that afterward he did, were by the impulſe of the evil Spirit. It is obſerved by Interpreters, that this was a perverſe and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, temper, into which <hi>Saul</hi> was caſt by <hi>Satan,</hi> through the juſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. It was, ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> ſomething more then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Vel ſi antea in eo fuerit, â bono Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu reprimebatur.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour, out of meer melancholy and diſcontent, he gave over the Government of the Empire, and be took himſelf to a private life, becauſe he could not root out the Chriſtians, whom with the uttermoſt violence he had perſecuted. This was the Judgement that befell <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:55318:156"/>for ſeven years he lived the life of a beaſt, and was baniſhed the ſociety of men, <hi>ſecundum imaginatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſuam,</hi> though not <hi>ſecundum ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem.</hi> And therefore <hi>Ierome</hi> obſerves, his figure and ſhape was not changed; for he ſaith, <hi>My underſtanding return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me. Oſtendit non formam ſe amiſiſſe ſed mentem,</hi> he loſt not the ſhape, but the underſtanding of a man, being given up to a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and madneſs, delivered over to a deluſion and rage of the unclean ſpirit. Suitable to which, the Lord threatens, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite thee with madneſs, and with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with aſtoniſhment of heart:</hi> To be delivered over to the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of a mans ſpirit, is the next way thereunto. There is a degree of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all the ways of ſin: There is madneſs in the heart of a man while he lives, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.3. And theſe were not Judgements proper and peculiar to thoſe times, but ſuch as the Lord will inflict alſo in all Ages, ſuitable to their diſcontents. But in an eſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:55318:156"/>in the fourth and fifth Vial, when the Vial is poured out upon the Sun, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Men were ſcorched with heat, and blaſphemed the name of God.</hi> There is no element whoſe torment is ſo exquiſite as that of fire: as <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> reports of the <hi>Atlantici,</hi> men that live under the South Pole, <hi>qui omnibus diris ſolem execrantur,</hi> becauſe they are ſcorched by it, therefore it is called the Torrid Zone. The Holy Ghoſt notes by it, as <hi>Brightman</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Mirae &amp; inuſitatae erunt acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitates;</hi> a ſtrange kind of bitterneſs of ſpirit ſhall be poured out upon men in Judgement. So in the fifth Vial, which is upon the Seat of the Beaſt, <hi>Men ſhall gnaw their tongues for pain, and blaſpheme the God of heaven:</hi> Gnaw their tongues, <hi>prae rabie &amp; furore;</hi> their grief and rage ſhall be ſuch, as they ſhall gnaw their tongues and gnaſh their teeth, as wicked men in hell are ſaid to do; yet this is the plague that ſhall follow, <hi>they ſhall blaſpheme the God of heaven. Non eſt exiſtimandum apertam fore blaſphemiam.</hi> It ſhall not be open direct blaſphemy; but as
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55318:157"/>Antichriſt doth open his mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, his name, his worſhip, his tabernacle, his Church, and his Saints, they that dwell in heaven. To be given up to either of theſe is the common uſe the devill makes of all the diſcontents of the ſpirits of men, at any of the dealings of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Satan makes uſe of it to this end, to make their lives uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, for they have no peace in their dayes, no comfort in their callings, becauſe their wills are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the will of God, and God carries on things againſt them, and they cannot attain their end, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in providence falls croſs, and therefore they are exceedingly diſpleaſed, they have no joy in their lives: for men may riſe up to ſuch diſcontent that their very lives may be a burthen to them. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 112.10. <hi>The horne of the righteous ſhall be exalted with honour; the wicked ſhall ſee and gnaſh their teeth and melt away.</hi> The word in the original ſignifies to melt by degrees, not all at once, but by little and little. It is
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55318:157"/>the ſame word that is uſed of the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of wax before the fire. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.3. So that mens rage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content ſhall conſume them. It ſhall be ſuch a conſtant griefe and vexation of ſpirit. And this ſhall be the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe that are enemies to the two witneſſes. <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.12. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been brought to a low ebb, they ſhall lie dead for three years and a halfe, and then they ſhall aſcend up into heaven, that is, be exalted unto the higheſt honour, by a voice from heaven, that is, <hi>ſupremi magiſtratus juſſu,</hi> and their enemies ſhall behold them. The devill could not wiſh a man a worſe miſchife then that his heart ſhould be engaged againſt any work of God that he will carry on, and be greived to ſee it proſper. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.2. It is ſaid that they were greived that the Apoſtle taught the people. There cannot be a greater miſchiefe befall a man then this which is the ground which inrages the devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is the cauſe of all the blaſphemy in hell, that their minds are contrary to the will of God,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55318:158"/>which yet they cannot withſtand.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Satan makes this uſe of it to keep men off from receiving direction from God; let God ſpeak what he will, the ſoul is in a diſturbance, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear; as it is to ſpeak to a man in a tumult, ſo it is with the noiſe and the riſing that is in a mans heart. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.9. It was a welcom meſſage a man would think to men in affliction, that God would deliver them, and that they ſhould inherit the promiſe made to their fathers; yet they hearkned not to <hi>Moſes</hi> becauſe of the anguiſh and bitterneſs of their ſpirits. This is the uſe that Satan intends to make of it, that men may neither receive counſell from God or man, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for either, which is one great uſe that he makes of the diſcontents of mens ſpirits at this day.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It keeps men from communion with God; for God will have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the ſpirit that ſtands in oppoſition to his will. <hi>Iob.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God and be at peace.</hi> The words in the originall are rendred <hi>Aſſueſce te cumillo,</hi> accuſtome
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55318:158"/>thy ſelf with him. Now that you may be accuſtomed to communion with God, he exhorts you to be at peace, that is <hi>ut Spiritus deprimat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolentes.</hi> So <hi>Zanchius.</hi> Let all thoſe heart riſings and unquiet diſpoſitions be ſuppreſt; elſe you can have no communion with him, neither can you attain any bleſſing from him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is to keep a man in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bittterneſs againſt the inſtruments, and to break forth againſt them. As when God would rent the Kingdom from <hi>Saul,</hi> and an evill ſpirit from the Lord came upon him, then he brake forth into all manner of violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>David,</hi> whom he looked upon as a competitor in the kingdome, whereas <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſeeing it was the mind of God ſate down quietly, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt be King, and I ſhall be next thee.</hi> So it was with <hi>Araunah;</hi> It is conceived that he was king of <hi>Iebus</hi> before they were conquered by <hi>David;</hi> and yet his ſpirit ſubmits to <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Wherefore is my lord the King come unto his ſervant?</hi> This temper of ſpirit will make a man lie in wait to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55318:159"/>revenge himſelf, and greedily to take it, though it be to his own ruine. As it was with <hi>Shimei</hi> his ſpirit was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered, he did but wait for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and having gotten it, though it were againſt his own life, yet with how much bitterneſs did he vent himſelf?</p>
            <p n="7">7. That it may tend at laſt to direct blaſphemy and revenge againſt God; for that is the end the devill aims at in all his temptations, and unto which they all come, if not here, yet in hell. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19. The devill is ſaid to touch men, and it is for no other end then to leave an impreſſion of deviliſhneſs upon them, to make them as farr ar may be equally guilty with himſelf; And the ſoul habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto rage and conſtant oppoſition againſt God, is fitted by Satan for ſuch a deviliſh deſign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is the excellency of ſuch a temper of ſpirit, to be alwayes calm and quiet, not given up to diſturbances within it ſelf?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> 1 Peter 3.4. Becauſe this is agreeable unto the nature of God. And
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55318:159"/>to this end was the viſion given to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> when his ſpirit was in a paſſion. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.11, 12. It was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> hath well obſerved; Firſt in this, that the way of Gods dealing with ſinners, is not by and by to deſtroy them, with a wind, with an earthquake, or with fire, but that he ſhews much patience toward them, and takes them away in a more ſtill and ſecret manner. <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culta &amp; tacita media non defutura ſuae providentiae.</hi> Secondly, to let him know what manner of prayer would take with God againſt ſinners, and prevail. <hi>Deum non commoveri affectibus &amp; perturbationibus incitari.</hi> Men think when they have prayed in paſſion, and have vehemently ſtirred themſelves, that God is ſo much moved as they; but he doth not appear in an earthquake, nor wind, or fire, but in a ſhort ſtill voice, when he is ſought unto from quiet ſedate affections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is agreeable to the ſpirit of Chriſt, who appeared <hi>in the form of a Dove. Animal non felle amarum, non morſibus ſaevum, non unguibus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentum.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55318:160"/>Cyprian.</hi> Therefore ſurely the more unquiet any mans ſpirit is, the leſs of the <hi>Dove</hi> there is in that man. For as the <hi>Dove</hi> is ſimple and without guile, ſo it is without gall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>Sine felle ſine dolo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The excellency of ſuch a temper of ſoul will appear in the ſutableneſs thereof unto a Chriſtian. Firſt by this every Saint as he is appointed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Kingdom (for ſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my father appointed unto me</hi>) ſo he hath the Kingdom of God erected and ſet up in his own ſoul, for <hi>the Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> Luke 17.2. There is <hi>regimen ſpirituale,</hi> that the Lord ſets up in the man. And the more any mans ſpirit is ordered and ſubjected unto the will of God, the more he is acted by the ſpirit without reluctancy, ſo much the more the Kingdom of God is exalted in the mans heart. <hi>In regno Dei omnia ſunt ſic ordinata ut quod eſt in homine praecipuum imperet caeteris non reluctantibus. Auſt.</hi> The more a man is led by the ſpirit, the more duc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tile and eaſie to be led he doth ſhew
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55318:160"/>himſelf to be; the more the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is ſet up in him. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11.6. <hi>A little child ſhall lead them;</hi> when the Spirit of God becomes as it were the <hi>forma informans</hi> of the man, that the ſoul obeys the dictates of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the body ſubjects it ſelf unto the rule of the ſoul, then is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God ſet up in the man. Confuſion, tumults, and uproars, may be ſutable unto the kingdoms of men, the <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of prey, the habitations of cruelty;</hi> but they are every way unfit for the Kingdom of God. Secondly, one ſpeciall ingredient in the Kingdom of God is peace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of God conſiſts not in meat nor in drink, but in righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy-ghoſt.</hi> It is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood here of the Kingdom of Grace and Glory. The Kingdom of Grace conſiſts not in externals, meat and drink, neither will the obſervation of theſe bring a man unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, but it conſiſts in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within. Now it is <hi>Auſtins</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that ſome are <hi>pacifici in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netipſis,</hi> men that keep a conſtant peace
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55318:161"/>and quietneſs of ſpirit within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, keep a conſtant Sabbath to God in their own ſouls, <hi>intus in corde Sabbatum noſtrum. Luther</hi> in one of his Epiſtles to a <hi>German</hi> Divine, writes thus, <hi>Dominus tua omnia faciat &amp; tu nihil facias, ſed ſis Sabbatum Chriſti.</hi> Let your hearts reſt and keep a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in you, and you in him; and it is in this reſt and quietneſs of ſpirit that the main of a Chriſtiau Sabbath doth conſiſt. Therefore the Sabbath here is a type of Heaven. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a Sabbatiſme for the people of God.</hi> It is true, in glory there ſhall be an externall reſt, <hi>they reſt from their labours;</hi> but the main ſhall be the inward reſt of the ſoul; the ſpirit ſhall keep a Sabbath to God eternally, when all ſinfull, unruly, inordinate actings of the ſpirit will be no more, but the ſoul enjoy perfect peace and quietneſs in the Lord. Now this is the peace in which the Kingdom of God doth conſiſt. <hi>Vera pax eſt a voluntate Dei non dividi, &amp; in his ſolis quae Deus diligit delectari. Harph.</hi> And this is properly the reſt of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55318:161"/>the ſoul in God, which every gracious heart ſhould ſtrive unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this quietneſs and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſpirit, there is a guarding and ſecuring power, <hi>Philip</hi> 4.7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi> As it is with the truths of God, the naturall man cannot receive them, and apprehend them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14 ſo it is with the peace of God, it is not to be underſtood of any man but he that feels it; the ſweetneſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is not to be known, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which is a ſpirituall ſenſe in thoſe that have <hi>their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern betwixt good and evill.</hi> Heb. 5. and the laſt. And this peace, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>ſhall keep your hearts and minds, Philippians.</hi> 4 7. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to keep as in a garriſon, to keep down tumults within, and to keep out enemies from without: that neither temptations from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out be let in, nor the deceits of the heart be let out; ſo as to carry a man away with them, and deceive him, but the heart by this peace and tranquillity is ſtrongly guarded againſt
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55318:162"/>both theſe; therefore it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent obſervation that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath, <hi>Mentem Spiritus Sanctus quam replet obumbrat:</hi> The Holy Ghoſt doth overſhadow the ſoul where he dwels, and keeps it in a quiet and calm frame, that neither unruly luſts break forth from within, nor temptations take with the ſoul from without to make it unquiet in it ſelf. A Spirit thus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted in obedience unto the will of God, is the ſureſt guard that a man can have in this world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hereby a man enjoys himſelf, which one of an unquiet ſpirit cannot do; <hi>In patience poſſeſs your ſouls.</hi> A man is not maſter of himſelf that is carried about with every paſſion, he hath no command of his own ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. and the laſt verſe, <hi>A man that hath no rule of his own ſpirit, is like a City broken down, and without walls;</hi> if an enemy come, he may invade and ſpoil as he will, for there be no walls to defend it; ſo it is with him that hath no reſtraint upon his own ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such a man ſhall be able to judge
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55318:162"/>clearly of any matter in difference which another cannot, whoſe ſpirit before is engaged or imbittered. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius ſolis non cernitur, nec turbatus fons reſpicientis reddit imaginem.</hi> It is a hard matter to ſee what is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of troubled water. <hi>Perit omne judicium cum res tranſit in affectum.</hi> A blood-ſhot eye ſees all things of the ſame colour: <hi>A bribe blinds the eyes of the wiſe,</hi> becauſe the affections bribe the Judgement; that I ſhould never much value the judgement of a man in a point of difference, whoſe ſpirit I know was violently engaged before hand.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A man is never nearer to the mercy he deſires, or the deliverance he expects, then when his ſoul is brought into ſuch a temper. <hi>David</hi> was never nearer the Kingdom, then when he became <hi>as a weaned childe;</hi> and we are never nearer the end of any affliction, then when it brings forth <hi>the quiet fruit of righteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. 12.11. The fruits of righteouſneſs are wrought by quietneſs in the ſoul; for <hi>the wrath of man will
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55318:163"/>never work the righteouſneſs of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This quietneſs of ſpirit in a wil concluded under the will of God, will make a man in all things chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in all things thankfull. Firſt, it is a mans duty always to be chearfull under all the diſpenſations of God: <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I ſay rejoyce, Phil.</hi> 4.4. The Spirit which the Saints receive, is the oyl of gladneſs, and with this unction you as well as Chriſt are anointed. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I will ſtand upon my watch-tower,</hi> that is, <hi>Mentis receſſus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> the retiring of the ſoul into it ſelf; and being thus in his Watch-Tower, though he doth ſuppoſe, <hi>The fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom, and there ſhould be no fruit in the vine, yet he will rejoyce in the Lord, and triumph in the God of his ſalvation,</hi> Hab. 3.18. A man that is in his Watch-tower, hath a quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into his own ſpirit, he can ſee himſelf ſecure in the midſt of danger, and can laugh at deſtruction. <hi>At fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and deſtruction thou ſhalt laugh,</hi> Job 5.22. There is a holy laughter from a principle of confidence, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55318:163"/>ſecurity. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.17. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a ſon was made known to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he fell upon his face, and laughed; from a confidence of the accompliſhment of the promiſe, his heart rejoyced in the Lord. Thus a godly man can laugh at danger let it be never ſo great, and let it threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten never ſo much, yet it doth not diſquiet his ſpirit, it doth not abate, but rather draw out his joy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It makes a man in all things thankfull, becauſe his will is concluded under the will of God. This is a mans duty. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God concerning you.</hi> In every thing, in every condition, in proſperity, in adverſity, in health, and ſickneſs, in poverty, and plenty, in honour, and diſhonour, when God ſeems to act for you, and when he ſeems to act againſt you, in the drawings near of God, and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of God, in life, in death, it is the will of God, that a man ſhould alwayes have his ſpirit in a thankfull frame. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Giving thanks
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55318:164"/>alwayes, and for all things unto God the Father, in the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, becauſe Gods will in all things is the rule of goodneſs; and to ſee that fulfilled, ſhould be matter of joy to the Saints, even when it doth croſs their own wills. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no condition but hath ſome good in it: For it is true in a ſpiritual ſenſe in this life, <hi>non dantur purae tenebrae.</hi> Vtter darkneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the life to come. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Glorifie the Lord in the fires;</hi> ſome render it fires, ſome vallies, both of them in Scripture expreſſing an afflicted condition. If the Lord caſt you into the fire to try you, you are to glorifie God in it, by giving him thanks. Now a man can never be thankful, whoſe ſpirit is not quieted and ſubdued unto the will of God. <hi>We love God becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> We apprehend his love, and we bleſs God, becauſe he hath bleſſed us firſt, and we apprehend his bleſſing. <hi>Gaudentes eſt gratias agere.</hi> It is the cheerefull man, that is the thankfull man; and no man can be cheerfull,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55318:164"/>but full of bitterneſs, and ſullenneſs, whoſe ſoule is not ſubjected to the will of God. Theſe are the excellencies of a ſpirit quieted and calmed, and concluded under Gods will as the rule of goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How ſhould a man attain ſuch a quiet frame of ſpirit, that he may keep his ſoul alway calm? The directions are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider it is Gods gift, <hi>he gives unto his beloved ſleep.</hi> Pſal. 121.2. By ſleep is not meant that of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but of the ſoul. <hi>Fideles etſi vitam agant laborioſam, compoſitis tamen &amp; tranquillis animis in fidei ſilentio ſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent ac ſi dormirent.</hi> They have a great deal of reſt and quietneſs in all their labours, and this is the gift of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt obtain it of God in his own way, and that is in the way of prayer; for as faith is the pacifying grace, ſo prayer is the quieting duty. <hi>Hannah</hi> after ſhe had prayed, though her ſpirit was unquiet before, yet ſhe <hi>went away and did eat and drink, and wat no more ſad.</hi> And David though
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55318:165"/>he did begin many <hi>Pſalms</hi> with a troubled ſpirit, yet he concludes with comfort, being quieted, and cheared under all the dealings of God with him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>In all things, let your prayer and requeſts be made known unto God: and the peace of God which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts:</hi> There is a double peace of the Saints, one wrought for us without us, and this is reconciliation with God: the other is peace within us, which is given unto the Saints as a return of prayer; the Spirit of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication becoming afterward a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of conſolation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the condition of the Saints, while they are in this life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33 46. <hi>He ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be the munitions of rocks, bread ſhall be given him, and his water ſhall be ſure.</hi> There is no affliction that can hurt thee, that doth not diſquiet thee: Men may plunder thee of thy goods, but let them not rob thee of thy patience. So it was with <hi>Job;</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan could not hurt him till he did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him: though he did fire his houſe,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55318:165"/>yet he could not fire his ſpirit. So it was with the Chriſtians in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, <hi>Amiſerunt omnia; nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid fidem, nunquid pietatem! hae ſunt opes Chriſtianorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Be much in acts of reliance and ſelf reſignation unto God, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the relation in which thou ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto him. To whom ſhould the children fly but to the father, and on whom ſhould he caſt his care? Do children lay up for the parents, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the parents for the children? <hi>Caſt</hi> therefore <hi>thy care upon him, for he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for thee. With him the fatherleſs find mercy.</hi> Thou never putteſt thy ſelf out of Gods care, till thou beginneſt to take the buſineſs out of Gods hands, and to take care for thy ſelf. <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for the Lord Iehovah is a rock of ages.</hi> Iſa. 26.3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Reaſon it out with thy own ſoul. This was <hi>Davids</hi> remedy. <hi>Why art thou caſt down oh my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> We ſhould call our ſouls unto an accompt, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the reaſon and the ground of our diſquiet. <hi>Commune with your own heatrs
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55318:166"/>upon your beds, and be ſtill</hi> Faith doth as much work by ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, as by any other way of acting whatſoever.</p>
            <p>We come now to the two laſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which are included in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And for diſpatch ſake, I ſhall put both into this one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>When the will of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, it is the duty of the Saints nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpeak nor act againſt it, they are to ceaſe from both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the opening hereof I muſt ſhew, Firſt, that the will of God, as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, is to be the rule of our wills and wayes. Secondly, That when it is manifeſted, it is the duty of the Saints neither to ſpeak nor act againſt it: Thirdly, Give the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And laſtly make an application of it to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The will of God manifeſted is to be the rule of our wills and ways. And here we are to conſider three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No man is to ſpeak or act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will. It is a ſtate
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55318:166"/>of ſin that <hi>fulfils the wills of the fleſh and of the mind.</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. A mans own will in oppoſition to the will of God, is the will of the devill. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and the laſt; we are ſaid to be <hi>led captive by him at his will.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be a rule unto any man either for ſpeaking or acting, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who hath no other god but the <hi>god of this world.</hi> Chriſt himſelf doth not make his wil the rule of his actions. <hi>I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Ioh. 6.38. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do not their own wils. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <hi>Gabriell</hi> was ſent; at <hi>the beginning of thy ſupplication the commandment came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee, Daniel.</hi> 9.23. The Angel did not go without a command. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.25. There is a firmament over the head of the living creatures, and a voice from the firmament, unto which the Angels did attend in all their motions, and when they ſtood they let down their wings. The will of God was the rule of all their actings, and ceſſation from actions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the will of God as manifeſted
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55318:167"/>that is the rule of all the actions of the creatures. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Things revealed are to us and our children for ever.</hi> This is a conſtant rule of all their motions for ever; there will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a time in this world, when the ſcripture which is the revelation of the will of God ſhall be laid aſide as of no uſe, for they belong unto us to do them. Therefore in the 12. of the <hi>Romans.</hi> 2. we are exhorted <hi>to prove what the good and acceptable will of God is.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth ſignifie 1. <hi>ſedulo explorare,</hi> diligently to try and ſearch. 2. <hi>approbare &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam conformare,</hi> to approve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our lives thereunto. Now it muſt be revealed, or a man can never diſcern it, or approve it, or conform his will or way unto it. God will have our ſervices to be <hi>reaſonable ſervices,</hi> which muſt be an obedience to his will as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted or made known unto us. Men require not obedience unto any law, ſo long as it is in the breaſt of the lawgiver; it never binds the ſubject till it be publiſhed, and proclaimed that all may take notice of it. So it is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55318:167"/>with the Lord who is the great and the only lawgiver.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The will of God is revealed and made known both by his word, and by his works, which are nothing elſe but as it were a comment upon his word.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By his word, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>the counſell of God, the mind of Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. and the laſt. <hi>I have written unto them the great things of my law.</hi> Hoſ. 8.12. declaring the whole will of God concerning the creatures obedience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By his works; <hi>for the worketh every thing according to the counſell of his own will.</hi> Epheſ. 1.11. Therefore whatſoever he doth in the world, it is but to diſcover the counſell of his will to the Saints. Therefore when <hi>Davids</hi> child was dead, he takes it for a manifeſtation of the will of God, and his heart is quieted under it. There is a double book which God hath given to the Saints to ſtudy in this ſtate of diſtance, till they come to behold his face; the book of nature, and the book of Scripture; and there are three things the Saints have
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55318:168"/>mainly to do in this life. 1. To obey his precepts. 2 To beleive his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 3 To ſubmit to his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Angels in heaven behold his face in glory, which is to them <hi>Cognitio meridiana,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſpeak; yet they ſtudy the word and the works of God, and know much of the will of God by them. <hi>Unto Angels and principalities and powers is made known by the Church, the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> Epheſ. 3.10. They are indeed preſent in our aſſemblies, and therefore women are exhorted to have power upon their heads, becauſe of the Angels. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17. They do not come to our aſſemblies to be inſtructed, by any of our ordinances; for they know much more then any of the Saints do; <hi>We know in part, and propheſie in part;</hi> but by the Church is meant, By the works of God toward the Church, and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall diſpenſations therein.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55318:169"/>therebe a meſſenger of Satan to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo as he muſt fight it out with a champion ſent from hell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and if the Lord will have it to continue upon him, and will not grant his prayer for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of it, he muſt not ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but ſit down and ſay, <hi>Thy grace is ſufficient for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Saints muſt not ſpeak againſt the will of God, when it is manifeſted, ſo they muſt not act againſt it. We have in Scripture three famous inſtances hereof. Firſt, when the Lord had declared his will, that he would give up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the King thereof into the hands of the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now the will of God is manifeſted, may they not uſe all lawfull means for their defence, and ſtand it out to the laſt man? they can but be delivered into his hands at laſt; but when the will of God is made known, <hi>Zedekiah</hi> muſt not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but he muſt go forth to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yield up himſelf, give up his City; and then the promiſe is, <hi>Thou ſhalt live, thou
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55318:170"/>and thy houſe, Ier.</hi> 38.17, 18. <hi>verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord had manifeſted his will for the deſtruction of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that wicked and idolatrous family; <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> joyns with <hi>Ahab</hi> in a War, that he might (contrary to the revealed will of God) preſerve him and his houſe from ruine, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19 2. the Lord ſends a prophet to reprove him; Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from the Lord; for <hi>he will riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the houſe of evill doers, and againſt the help of them that work iniquity.</hi> If his will be manifeſted to deſtroy a family, let not the beſt men interpoſe, and act againſt the will of God as manifeſted; for they will be ſo farr from recovering it, that they will periſh with it; proud helpers ſhall ſtoop before him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Lord is accompliſhing his own great work againſt <hi>Babylon, Myſtery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots,</hi> againſt all humane inventions, under all forms, the worſhip of God, as taught by the precepts of men,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55318:170"/>and when the will of God is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the pouring out of ſeverall vials; after all this the kings of the earth ſhall be gathered together to the great battell at <hi>Armageddon,</hi> for Antichriſts reſtitution and eſtabliſhment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.16. This gathering together and rallying their ſcattered troops, is their ſin, and ſhall be their ſnare and ruine. For if the will of God be manifeſted, it will be the down-fall of all that come in to joyn with them in ways of oppoſition againſt it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The grounds of this doctrine are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The will of God hath a majeſty, and a ſoveraingty goes with it; for he is the great, the only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> none governs by will, as an abſolute monarch but himſelf. And therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> commends thoſe Princes as happy men, <hi>qui poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſuam divinae majeſtati famulam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt.</hi> And if there be a ſoveraignty, then every diſobedience unto this will, and every oppoſition againſt it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55318:171"/>in word or action is rebellion, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. There is a rebellion againſt God, becauſe his will hath a ſoveraignty in it, and his law is a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law. Therefore the Lord cals the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who were a diſobedient people, <hi>the land of rebels,</hi> Jer. 50.21. For to ſpeak or act againſt the will of God as manifeſted, is a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the Lord. <hi>Ier.</hi> 28.16. The Lord ſaith, I will put an iron yoke upon the neck of theſe nations, and they ſhall ſerve the king of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but <hi>Hannaniah</hi> the Prophet comes and tells them it ſhould not be ſo, and therefore they ſhould ſtand it out and defend themſelves as long as they could. A man would have thought this had been good counſell, and courage. No, the will of the Lord being manifeſted, he muſt die and be caſt off from the face of the earth, for teaching them to ſtand out againſt the Soveraignty of God, and he is therefore ſaid to teach rebellion againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. There is an omnipotency
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55318:171"/>in the will of God; for his will crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. laſt, and it is the ſame omnipotent will that rules all things. Now ſhall a creature ſpeak or act againſt ſuch a will, and thereby become a fighter againſt God? <hi>Acts</hi> 5.39. <hi>If the thing be of God it ſhall ſtand,</hi> do not oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, whatſoever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſtubborneſs and a gainſaying ſpirit, the Saints of God muſt abhorr: there be ſome ſins that men commit out of ignorance, becauſe the will of God is not clearly made known to them: But there are ſome ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of knowledg, and there the will is engaged; this act of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs proceeds from a gainſaying principle. In <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78. <hi>v.</hi> 8. a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor taken from a beaſt that will not be guided by the rider: and ſaith a learned interpreter, it notes ſtubborneſs and pride, in a way of oppoſition againſt God. Now I pray conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, the more a man doth manifeſt a ſtiff neck, the greater the evill is, and ſhould be the more carefully
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55318:172"/>avoided by the Saints: but when the will of God is diſcovered, then to go againſt it, muſt needs proceed from a ſtubborn and gainſaying people. When the hand of the Lord is lifted up, they will not ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Fourthly, Its a great evill in the Saints of God to be heady, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. to be heady, violent, haſty men: when their will is engaged againſt the will of God, nothing can ſtop them; there is a naturall and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall madneſs; there is a ſinfull mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heart of man by nature. But a judiciall hardneſs is when God gives a man over to it in judgment; he makes himſelf mad ſinfully, and God makes him mad judicially: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. The dumb aſs ſpeaking with mans voice, forbad the madneſs of the Prophet. Wherein did <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> madneſs lie? that he deſired to go when he had ſuch earneſt intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, though the will of God were manifeſted to the contrary. Its true, here was <hi>Balaams</hi> wickedneſs, but where lay his madneſs? when God
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55318:172"/>had ſhewn him ſo many things to make it appear that his way was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe before him, his aſs ſtumbles and runs his foot againſt the wall; yet he replies to him again, and goes on in his way: here was his madneſs, that when the will of God was ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and remarkably diſcovered, for all that to go on his way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Fifthly, this makes a man in Gods accompt to become a ſon of <hi>Belial:</hi> that ſignifies as <hi>Hierom</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, a man that is without a yoke, a lawleſs man, a name given to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill upon that accompt; the worſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that can be laid upon a man, is to be the ſon of <hi>Belial;</hi> Its the worſt word he could have uſed: a child of the Devil, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Elymas,</hi> not by nature, but by image: on what ground doth God give a man hat ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? when his will is manifeſted, and thou oppoſeſt it, thou art become a child of <hi>Belial.</hi> It is a very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. laſt verſe, there were ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> that deſpiſed <hi>Saul,</hi> and brought him no preſents. <hi>Saul</hi> was made a King, but by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55318:173"/>will: They ſet up kings but not by me (ſaith God) by my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not by my approbation: he gave them a king in his wrath, and took him away in his anger. <hi>Saul</hi> was made king but by Gods permitting will; yet thoſe that did not ſtoop to the very permitting will of God, when it was manifeſted, the text ſaith, they were ſons of <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Laſtly, thou wilt ſurely periſh in thy own oppoſition: he that either ſpeaks or acts againſt the will of God manifeſted, will periſh in his own oppoſition: <hi>Iude</hi> 11. They periſhed in the gain-ſaying of <hi>Corah.</hi> God had gloriouſly manifeſted his will for <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron:</hi> But <hi>Corah</hi> and his company will uſurp the prieſthood; but now the text ſaith, they periſhed in that gainſaying: ſo Chriſt told <hi>Paul,</hi> it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks; in thy gainſaying thou wilt periſh. And ſo much for opening and explication of the Doctrine. Now for application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> There is but one uſe that I
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55318:173"/>will make of it, and that is of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, with which I will cloſe the text; and I deſire you, nay ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that liberty of ſpeech that the Goſpell hath given us, I charge you to take notice of it: In all things wherein God ſhall manifeſt his will, do you look upon that will, both as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and ſoveraign; and therefore do not dare to ſpeak or fight againſt it; take heed you be not found fighters againſt God; do not oppoſe any thing that God will have ſtand: give me leave to take the application apart.</p>
            <p>Firſt, do not ſpeak againſt it: the Apoſtle ſaith, the tongue is a world of evill, full of deadly poyſon. Its a great evill for a man to be given over to a poyſoned tongue: the fire of hell is in that mans heart that doth ſo conſtantly fire his tongue: this is an evill that godly men may fall into, men that otherwayes are of a meek and quiet temper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.32. They provoked <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpirit, the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt man of all the earth: and what follows now? <hi>verſe</hi> 33. he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly with his lips; that is the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55318:174"/>ordinary fruit of an imbittered ſpirit; there are times of ſpeaking, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſilence: there are two times eſpecially wherein men ſhould be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Firſt do not ſpeak when you are in paſſion, when your own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are up. <hi>Moſes</hi> had been a great deal better to have held his peace, then to have ſpoken unadviſedly, when his ſpirit was imbittered: paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an ill counſellour, and truly as ill a ſpeaker. Secondly, do not ſpeak when God is angry: oh remember <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Let us enter into the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cities and be ſilent, for our God hath put us to ſilence; he hath made us to drink of the gall, becauſe we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him.</hi> When the will of God is manifeſted, do not ſpeak againſt it.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſix directions herein that I muſt give you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direction</hi> 1. Firſt, when the will of God is manifeſted, ceaſe your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings, ſilence your reaſonings; do not ſay, why do the wicked proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and why doth God ſuffer men
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55318:174"/>to do this and this? why doth ſuch a party prevail, and not the other? why hath this ſucceſs, and not the other? remember when the will of God is manifeſted, let not the potſherd call the potter any more to accompt: let this be enough to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thee, which did the Lord Jeſus, <hi>even ſo father, for ſo was thy good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direction</hi> 2. Secondly, ceaſe your lying; be ſilent in that, to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way lying, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let every man ſpeak truth to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> not only the way of lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and whiſpering againſt their brethren; thats not the lying I now intend: but there is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Lord, put it away: and what is that you will ſay, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.12. <hi>They believed the Lord, and ſaid, it is not he;</hi> take heed of that lying: Its an evill to belie men, and you will find it ſo one day: take heed, do not belie the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Thirdly ceaſe your
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55318:175"/>mocking, ſilence them too; the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of mockers is the worſt ſociety of men you can fall into, and the chair of the ſcorner is the worſt ſeat you can ſit down in. Be no more mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.22. Truly mocking proceeds from a high pitch of pride, and pride goes immediatly before a fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 4. Fourthly, ſilence your ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, reviling, and bitter ſpeeches. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, ſome mens tongues cut like a ſharp raſor; and that is a remarkable place <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.9. <hi>They ſet their mouths againſt heaven, and their tongues run through the world:</hi> what is that? their mouths againſt heaven, that is, ſaith a learned Interpreter, when men ſpeak proudly concerning God and the things of God, the ways of God, the works of God, and the Saints of God: they ſtretch their mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven, <hi>and their tongues run through the world;</hi> they have to do with all perſons, with all imployments; all the world over their tongues walk. <hi>Solomon</hi> I remember ſaith, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.3.
